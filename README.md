# Introduction
This is a guide on how to pull, pack, develop, and unpack the mod so that your changes can be pushed to version control. Familiarity with how git and docker work are not required to be able to complete this guide. If there are any questions, do not hesitate to ask them on the forums or on the discord.

## Contribution Guidelines
There are some things that should be kept in mind for potential contributors:
- Use descriptive, concise messages to describe commits, branches, etc.
- Do not abuse your access to the module and its resources to add cheats (i.e: hide gold, epics, etc in areas you're working on).
- Do not distribute, copy, or leak the contents of the repository to any outside parties. Only staff (developers, testers, dms, admins) should be privy to the contents of the module.
- Do not deliberately sabotage the work of others.
- Commits sizes must be reasonable, with some exceptions, or they will be reverted. This can be avoided by committing work in small batches.
