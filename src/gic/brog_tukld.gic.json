          "value": "This chest will spawn either a fixed amount of loot from a loot bin, or a random amount. The two choices may be freely combined (for instance, 1 fixed loot + 0-3 random loot).\r\n\r\nOnce all loot is taken from the chest, it will not spawn anymore for a fixed amount of time. If no time is defined, 20 minutes is the default.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVariables\r\n------\r\n\r\n\r\nTimeLimit (float): defines how long it takes for the next batch of loot to spawn. This is in SECONDS (i.e. 60.0 = one minute ). Optional - default is 1200.0.\r\n\r\nRandomLoot (int): defines the upper integer of how much random loot you want to spawn (i.e., putting in 3 would spawn 0-3 random loot pieces). Optional - default is 0.\r\n\r\nFixedLoot (int): defines how much loot you always want spawned. This can be combined with RandomLoot. Optional - default is 0.\r\n\r\nLootLevel (int): defines which level of loot bin to be used. 1 is uber low, 3 is medium, 5 is uber, etc. Required - the chest will not work if LootLevel is not set from 1 to 5.\r\n\r\n"
