Everybody can bind to a god, and pray to it, but Clerics get the best mileage out of it. You can bind to a god in two ways:\r\n\r\na. You search for its idol in the game. Click on it to open a conversation which allows you to bind to it if you have the right alignment.\r\nb. You enter the deity's name in the deity field on character creation. Mind that the deity will fry you if you pray without meeting the alignment requirements.\r\n\r\nNB: You may reconsider your faith until reaching level 10, ie, you may choose a new deity before you hit level 10. After that, deities can only be changed with DM assistance and a good RP reason."
