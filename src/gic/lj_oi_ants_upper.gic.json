It pulls all information from the variables set on the \"lj_randchestspwn\" trigger.\r\n\r\nThe Tag and the Resref of the chest-to-spawn must match in order to make sure duplicates don't appear. By default, the script uses the placeable chest lj_randchestspwn, but any chest can be used by setting the \"resref\" variable.\r\n\r\nPlace waypoints in your area tagged with the \"resref\" variable on this trigger. By default, this Resref is lj_randchestspwn and is on the palette in Waypoints > Special > Custom 4 > Randomized Chest Spawn Location. You do not need to place these waypoints within your trigger. I've also fixed the orientation so that it spawns according to the direction that the waypoint is facing.\r\n\r\n\r\nVariables on the Trigger\r\n----------\r\n\r\nstring resref: The tag/resref of the chest to spawn and tag of waypoints. Default is lj_randchestspwn\r\n\r\nint BlockTime: The cooldown from this trigger spawning a new chest in seconds. Default is 1 hour (3600 seconds)\r\n\r\nint OncePerReset: Setting 1 one will mean this fires 1/reset per player. Default is 0\r\n\r\nint SearchDC: If set, this will require a search check to find chests. Default is 0\r\n\r\nint LockedDC: If set, this will lock the chest and set an unlock DC. Default is 0\r\n\r\nint ChestAppearance: You may set this to customize the appearance of your chest by referencing the index number in Placeables.2da. Default is 0 for the most basic-looking chest.\r\n\r\nstring ChestName: If set, customize the name of the spawned chest. Default is \"Chest\"\r\n\r\nstring ChestDescription: If set, customize the description of the spawned chest. Default is \"This heavy chest may have been used for storing valuables.\"\r\n\r\n----------\r\nIf using a custom chest, you do not need the following variables. If using the default, these will enable you to set amount of loot and quality of loot:\r\n\r\nint RandomLoot: defines the upper integer of how much random loot you want to spawn (i.e., putting in 3 would spawn 0-3 random loot pieces). Default is 1\r\n\r\nint FixedLoot: defines how much loot you always want spawned. This can be combined with RandomLoot. Default is 1\r\n\r\nint LootLevel: defines which level of loot bin to be used. 1 is uber low, 3 is medium, 5 is uber, etc. Required - the chest will not work if LootLevel is not set from 1 to 5. Default is 1\r\n\r\nfloat TimeLimit: defines how long it takes for the next batch of loot to spawn within the chest. This is in SECONDS (i.e. 60.0 = one minute ). If this is not set, it will default to the BlockTime. This is different from BlockTime in that you can have a chest spawn once, but have its contents refresh multiple times before it is destroyed. Default is 0 (and thus reverts to BlockTime)"
