It MUST start with \"tst_\" and I advice to use a descriptive phrase for the rest of the name. Look at the available waypoints for examples. You can use up to 12 characters.\r\n\r\nVariables\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\ntst_boss_switch: set to 1 to spawn the boss blueprint\r\ntst_max_1: maximum amount of spawntype 1\r\ntst_resref_1: buleprint of spawntype 1\r\ntst_resref_boss: blueprint id of the boss\r\ntst_spawntypes: the number of spawntypes to use, excluding the boss\r\n\r\nValues\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\ntst_boss_switch: 0 or 1\r\ntst_max_1: 0 to 5\r\ntst_resref_1: the resref you find in the properties of a monster\r\ntst_resref_boss: idem\r\ntst_spawntypes: 0 to 4\r\n\r\nMind that you can use one boss and a maximum of 4 spawntypes.
