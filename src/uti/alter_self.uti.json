You can change into a member of your own kind or even into yourself. \n\nIf the new form is capable of speech, you can communicate normally. You retain any spellcasting ability you had in your original form, but the new form must be able to speak intelligibly (that is, speak a language) to use verbal components and must have limbs capable of fine manipulation to use somatic or material components. \n\nYou can freely designate the new form's minor physical qualities (such as hair color, hair texture, and skin color) within the normal ranges for a creature of that kind. The new form's significant physical qualities (such as height, weight, and gender) are also under your control, but they must fall within the norms for the new form's kind. You are effectively disguised as an average member of the new form's race.\n\nOOC Information:\n\nUsing it once will transform you into the defined form, using it again will transform you back into the original form.\n\nThe widget works off six variables: alter_skin, alter_hair, alter_tattoo1, alter_tattoo2, alter_wings, alter_tail. The last two are optional.\n\nTo set a variable, type in ##SetVarInt alter_skin x, where x is the colour value, and then target the widget. Obviously, it'd be ##SetVarInt alter_hair x to change hair colour, and so on."
