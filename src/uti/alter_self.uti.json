You can change into a member of your own kind or even into yourself. \n\nIf the new form is capable of speech, you can communicate normally. You retain any spellcasting ability you had in your original form, but the new form must be able to speak intelligibly (that is, speak a language) to use verbal components and must have limbs capable of fine manipulation to use somatic or material components. \n\nYou can freely designate the new form's minor physical qualities (such as hair color, hair texture, and skin color) within the normal ranges for a creature of that kind. The new form's significant physical qualities (such as height, weight, and gender) are also under your control, but they must fall within the norms for the new form's kind. You are effectively disguised as an average member of the new form's race.\n\nOOC Information:\n\nUsing it once will transform you into the defined form, using it again will transform you back into the original form.\n\nThe widget works off alot of variables which are set with ##SetVarInt\nalter_skin # (Changes skin colors only)\nalter_hair # (Changes hair colors only)\nalter_tattoo1 # (Changes tattoo1 color only)\nalter_tattoo2 # (Changes tattoo2 color only)\nalter_wings # (Changes wings model)\nalter_tail # (Changes tail model)\nalter_head # (Changes head model)\nalter_model # (Changes the skin/model of the PC, only use dynamic 0-6)\n\n##SetVarString alter_portrait X (Changes portrait, e.g. f_elf_01)\n\nYou can also set the scale of the desired form! \n##SetVarFloat pc_scale 1.0 (this is for the size of the player, this should automaticly be set by usage)\n##SetVarFloat cr_scale 1.0 (sets the size of the new form)\n\nchanging the numbers to whatever scale they're supposed to be! 1.0 is default. every +/- 0.01 is 1% The usual range is 0.9 to 1.1, so just ask them what they want.\n"
