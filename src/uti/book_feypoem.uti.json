For who can catch something as transitory as the words and poetry of the feyish?\n\nPerhaps one day, I shall also record our history here, the history of my beloved Bubbles, the mistress dear to my heart--and thus perhaps proving the existence of a \"heart\" within a beholderkin. For such am I, and here, as in all of the Isles around and near Amia, I am called by my fey \"Tulip,\" and seek to capture a bit of my mistress on paper, in the hopes that when we are but dust, her words may be remembered still, and I, as well, in recording them.\n\nHer most recent poetry I shall start with first, as it is the freshest in my memory. For as she has wandered, she hears the singing and the poetry of many varying creatures, mundane and magical, and her mind, full of the spirit of Revelrie, seems to remember them all, and then she recites them. The titles are my own, as she has never been so formal.\n\nThe Tale of the Fish-Maiden\n\nThere once was a little fish maiden\nWho swam so under the sea;\nThe bluish light would guide her,\nThrough rocks and shells and weeds;\n\nBut a big black crab\nLived under a rock\nBy the little fish maid\nWho swims so under the sea;\n\nAnd he liked nothing more\nThan to eat at the eyes\nOf the little fish maids\nWho swim so under the sea;\n\nSo he plotted and he planned\nAnd he laid out a trap\nOf woven weeds and pin-cushion urchins\nAnd he laid in wait\nFor the little fish maiden,\nGolden and blue-scaled pretty fish maiden,\nWho swims so under the sea;\n\nHe heard coming near\nSwish, swish and a flash of maiden hair,\n\nHe watched for her golden tail,\nSwish, swish and beautiful glow came near;\n\nKer-splash! The net!\nIt twisted about,\nAnd the shrill and bubbled yell\nOf a sweet and little fish maiden\nWho swims so under the sea;\n\nFor it pinched and it grabbed\nAnd it tackled and it stung\nThe little fish maid at the bottom of the sea;\n\nNow comes the blackened crab man,\nSnapping at her with claws--snap, snap!\nAnd he chokes with the cackling,\nAnd he cracks with his shuffling as he comes near\nTo the Lovely little sea maid,\nGlittering and panicking\nAs she tries to swim so under the sea;\n\n'Little fish maid,' he says, crackling his claws,\n'I am gratified to see--you did not keep watch\nAs you should have done, while you swam so under the sea,'\n\n'Oh blackened crab,' the maiden says,\n'Your kind is known to me.\nYou will have my eyes and my swishing tail,\nAnd add them to your stew,\nTo your bubbling stewpot under the sea.'\n\n'I will, in fact,' says the blackened crab,\nAnd approaches the deadly net.\n\n'But what if I were to offer you something\nFar, far tastier yet?'\n\nThe black crab stops, and crackles his claws,\nAnd examines the gold and blue maid;\n'In truth?' he asks, for he really was a\nVery Greedy Crab;\n\n'Indeed!' she cries, 'I know just where\nMountains of oysters lie!\nFor I swam just past, an hour ago,\nAnd the pearl beds caught my eye;'\n\nNow oysters dear the crab did love,\nFar above and beyond the rest;\nFor what are eyes to the crackable shells\nAnd the delicious morsels inside?\n\nHe smacked his mouth, and thought of this,\nAnd hmm'd and haw'd beside;\n\n'So fish maid, I will set you loose,\nAnd you swear you'll lead the way?\nFor if you swim off, fooling me,\nI'll just catch you another day--\nAnd no mercy then! I'll eat you up,\nAnd all your sisters beside!\nMark my words, girl, it will come,\nBefore you next see the high tide!'\n\nThe fish maid then, she flashed her tail,\nHelplessly under the snare,\n'I tell you truth, on mine and my sister's lives,\nThe oysters you'll find there.'\n\n'Fair enough,' said the crab,\n'Since you bet your life and your sister's too\nOn my sure success, I'll let you loose--\nNow just a moment--\nThese urchin pins are a mess.'\n\nSo the fish maid's loose,\nNo worse for the trap, and motions\nFor her captor to follow--\nShe led him through the sandy moors\nAnd rockbeds, long and hollow.\n\nWhen finally he cries out:\nHe is tired--for he must walk,\nWhile she does glide,\nShe turns about and looks at him,\nAnd says, 'Why, I'll carry you besides.'\n\n'Well, thank you, miss, that's kind of you,\nWe'll go along in style;\nFor many long years I've been under my rock,\nAnd not travelled so many a mile.'\n\nSo she grabs him up with her clever hands,\nAnd swims with him this way for a while;\n\n'I'm awfully sleepy, with this gentle movement,'\nThe Crab King says--\n'Then rest your head a while.'\n\nAnd while he sleeps, she swoops him up,\nStraight up from the briny deeps, and\nHolds him aloft on the surface of the sea,\nTil a pelican spies this feast on a platter,\nAnd helps himself to deep sea crab,\nHeld aloft on such a strange ladder.\n\nA swoop, a swish, a cry, a gulp,\nAnd the fish maid cries, 'Harumph!\nForever gone are your greedy ways!\nAnd my sisters and I are safe!'\nAnd she flips her tail in a bump on the sea,\nA golden flash that a sailor does see,\nAnd tells the tale to his son, \n\nOf a little fish maiden under the sea,\nOf a glittery golden\nBeautiful Maid\nWho swims so under the sea.\n\nThis one is briefer, but also recent ~Tulip\n\nWhen itty bitty little cat\nWith itty bitty little pat\nHas itty bitty little mat\nUnder its dainty feet,\n\nThen itty bitty little cat\nWith itty bitty little mat\nGets itty bitty little pat\nThen purrings you will see;\n\nBut itty bitty little cat\nWith itty bitty purrings at\nThe itty bitty little mat\nIs rare as rare can be--\n\nFor itty bitty little cat\nWith itty bitty kitten mat\nWill tear apart a bitty rat\nAs quick as quick can be;\n\nSo itty bitty little cat\nWhile you wonder what she's at,\nDo not, do not forget to pat!\nOr else you end up as the rat!\n\nThe most beautiful song that comes to mind was one she sang to her beloved, named Jakes, at the time I heard her sing it most, in the fits of his unrest, here recorded ~Tulip\n\nWhere the Mists meet the Moon\n\nUnderneath a veil of stars,\nBeyond horizon's gloom,\nCome with me, tonight, my love,\nWhere the mists meet the Moon;\n\nThe path is ending,\nThe way was pain,\nBut the time is now\nTo meet me, love,\nWhere the mists meet the Moon;\n\nFar away, far away, she calls,\nTo answer love's sweet swoon,\nFar away, far away, my love,\nTo where the mists meet the Moon;\n\nTime is past, evening fallen,\nCome with me, love\nThough the tone be solemn;\nCome away with me, love:\nTo where the Mists meet the Moon;\n\nFar away, far away, she calls,\nTo answer love's sweet swoon,\nFar away, far away, my love,\nTo where the mists meet the Moon"
