It is a vast desert like place, being filled with deep crevasses and pits, pillars of flame rising up into the red clouds that adorn the sky. The abyssal city of Zanshibon is the only landmark for miles around, standing tall and proud amid the ravages of the blood wars that rage around it. Zanshibon is ruled by an arch demon of massive power, Paush, who sometimes lures adventurers from the isle of Amia to battle in his war for riches and power. This layer is also home to many other powerful demons; mostly all soldiers of the Blood Wars who will attack at a whim's notice. My warning is to be especially cautious here for the demons watch from every corner here."
