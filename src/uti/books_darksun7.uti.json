His fork fueled his power and he almost never let it leave his hand. The power of his fork allowed him to read his subjects' minds, and to control them at will. Therefore it was a powerful artifact, and no one but Archemodeus knew of its making.\n \nThe fork has now become a scepter of power for the 432nd layer. He who possesses it, also possesses the layer's inhabitants. While Archemodeus is locked away in a dimensional prison, his Trident is hidden so none might find it. The fork itself is described as being around 12ft long with three barbed prongs sprouting from it's tip. It radiates magnificent thoughts of evil, yet while held it's power does not radiate from the fork itself, rather from the wielder. While on the 432nd layer, many creatures, both good and evil, long to grip it's shaft yet little do they realize that they merely become a vassal for it's unholy powers."
