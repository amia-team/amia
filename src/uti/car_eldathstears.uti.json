She spent her life caring and protecting the forest around where this plant grows. There was a day that came when the forest here was visited by an undead being of terrible power. This woman did her best to defend the forest, but she was sorely outmatched, and after receiving mortal wounds, she crawled back to the very spot where this plant grows, whispering her last words begging for Eldath's forgiveness at her failure to save the forest. Her prayers were answered and Eldath herself appeared by her side as she slipped away, the wounds of the undead horror claiming her life, and pulling at her soul, trying to corrupt it. Eldath wept for her follower, and where her tears fell upon the ground, this plant would grow. "
