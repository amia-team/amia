The ribs in the crests end in curving horns. These horns are smooth, dark, and oval in cross-section, and curve slightly inward toward the dragon's spine. The largest horns grow from the top of the head. In older dragons, the smaller horns often develop secondary points. The dragon also has small horns on its lower jaw and chin. A bronze dragon has a beaklike snout and a pointed tongue. It has a small head frill and a tall neck frill. A bronze dragon has webbed feet and webbing behind the forelimbs. Its scales are smooth and flat. Their pupils fade as they age, until in the oldest the eyes resemble glowing green orbs.\n\nA smell of sea spray lingers about them.\n\nCreated by:\nAaliyah\n~Gold Dragon Knight of Bahamut~\nIn Honor of the King of Good Dragons!"
