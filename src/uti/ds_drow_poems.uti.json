See the matron weakness spurn!\n\nBoiling Ice, Freezing Flames..\nGlowing Dark, Blinding Grace..\nWise and subtle in her zeal\nTerror, so desireable, unreal\n\nSoftness of her cruelty...\nNau..\nWords.. futility!\nOne is enough:\n\nPower\n\n---------------------------------------------------\nVesz'fein Qos'Yutsu\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nBlood trails from her clever quill,\nScripting sonnet and song, laced with ill will.\nTempt her temper and be entwined\nIn the entropic ecstasy of her design.\nA little taste is all it takes\nTo win her wrath and be laid to waste.\nBut like all things dead she has her draw,\nThat fatal attaction as the tip of the claw.\nAs a Siren lulls and lures as it sings,\nSo does she, but it's chaos she brings.\nIt's never a challenge for her to entice,\nEnlisting aide for victory's vice.\nShe can scream a scandal in the loveliest tone,\nAnd master an empire from atop her throne.\nAnd when silence has settled, those now living at rest,\nThe legend lives on of our first ilharess.\n\n---------------------------------------------------\nNaref Qos'Yutsu\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nNot marble, nor the gilded monuments\nOf Ilharessen past shall outlive this powerful rhyme;\nBut you shall shine more bright in these contents\nThan unswept stone besmeared with sluttish time,\nWhen chaotic war shall statues overturn,\nAnd broils root out the work of masonry,\nNor Vhaerun's dagger, nor Eilistraee's dance fire shall burn\nthe living record of your memory.\n'Gainst death and all abvious enmity\nShall you pace forth: your praise shall still find room\nEven in the eye of all posterity\nThat wear this world out to the ending doom\nSo, till the judgement that yourself arise,\nYou live in this, and dwell in our dark majesty's eyes.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------\nXÃ¼llae Ouss'ana\n---------------------------------------------------\nIn the chill dark have I great rejoicing\nWhen her servants kill the isles foul peace\nThe lightnings from black heaven flash crimson\nAnd the fierce shadows roar me their music\nCavern winds shriek through the tunnels mad, opposing\nAnd through all the rivven skies drow blades clash\n\nI love to see the night fall blood-crimson\nAs I watch her form through the dark flash\nAnd it fills all my cruel heart with rejoicing\nAnd pries wide my mouth with dark music\nWhen I see her so scorn and defy peace\nLolth's lone Hand 'gainst all light opposing\n\n---------------------------------------------------\nXanos Tinnerai\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nFire in her eyes.\nBlood pooling below her feet.\nA name screamed.\nSilence.\n\n----------------------\nSerion Vandree:\n\nThere is nothing but divine in this dream\nWhich walks on these grounds where I stand.\nA goddess in drow form, a queen over queens,\nInfluencing the very breath of this metropolis and giving it pulse\nUnifying chaos, greed and lust within a couple of words.\nShe holds this power, whilst accepting the responsibilities\nThat time waits for no one though she doesn't wait for time\n'Cause Lloth is the bitter truth.\nShe is the venom that comes from her lips,\nOne whose beauty can't be truly seen without divine eyes.\nNonetheless everyone tries.\nHer moon light hair with her rich starless night skin\nWith a mind that can fill endess novels\nAnd give hue to a colorless world.\nHer authority is what sustains, inspires and transfixes all artists\nShe is the ideal muse, a masterpiece portrait\nAnd the perfect distraction.\nA dream figure that couldn't be dreamed by any mortal.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------\nKelafein Qos'Yutsu\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nLost in darkness...\nLight is not welcomed here\nSkin dark like the opaqueness of a shadow...\nEyes seeing all movement\nEars hearing everything\nBody posed to pounce\nReady for the final kill\nRoaming the streets\nA creature of the night\nSeeking blood to quench the thrist\nWeapons sink into flesh\nspilling the sweet blood\nVictim lies, slowly dying\nNever again to see the light of day\nSunlight starts to creep\nAlong the ground\nSeeking the shadows\nThe night retreats\nAs does the creature\nGoing into hiding\nThe await the sign\nOf the ever dark night\n\n---------------------------------------------------\nNadorhaun Vandree\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nMay the road rise up to meet you,\nMay the wind be ever at your back\nMay the darkness chill your face\nAnd the enemy fall upon your fields\nAnd until we meet again,\nMay Lloth hold you in the hollow of her hand\n\nMay those who love her, love her;\nand those who don't love her,\nmay Loth turn their hearts;\nand if she doesn't turn their hearts,\nmay she turn their ankles\nso we'll know them by their limping."
