      "0": "A weighty ornamental scepter about the length of a short sword. Its head is composed of three metallic spheres, each double the size of the pommel. All three are weighted differently, from light to comically heavy, making the object difficult to hold straight, let alone use effectively.\n\nDisciples of the Sun Soul approach the taking of a life very seriously, and their more zealous members created the Weight of Judgement to temper their anger. By forcing themselves to use the unweildly scepter when committing violence, they thought they'd naturally come to wonder if taking such risks to harm someone else was worth it. Somewhere along the way, craftsmen started imbuying the scepters with strengthening wards to offset the inherent risks, completely defeating the purpose, but making a fine weapon of war.\n\nOne of the ways in which monks seek enlightenment is through rigorous meditation. It is common for them to choose a focus, an object of reverence which serves as a bridge to the spiritual. It is almost always calming to at least one sense, on which the monk focuses to tap into their inner world with very little notice."
