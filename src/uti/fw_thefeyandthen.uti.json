He sent her on a dangerous quest to retrieve a dragon scale and prove her love for him.\n\nThe lovely fey was determined to prevail, and she did.  After returning triumphantly with the dragon scale, the necromancer knew he and the fey were destined to be together.\n\nThey joined themselves with the bonds of magic becoming master and familiar, and shortly thereafter with the bonds of words becoming husband and wife.  Their love gifted them with a wonderful daughter.\n\n(The last half of the book is blank, as if there is still more to be written.)"
