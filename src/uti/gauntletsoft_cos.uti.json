The mage called out to an old friend of his that happened to be a powerful diviner and between them they created the large topaz stones that sit in these bracers.\n\nA few moons later the thief was caught and he met his end brutally as the mage let his full wrath out in burst after burst of magical chaos. In his blind rage his tower was destroyed as well and all that was found were these bracers and a handful of other magical items."
