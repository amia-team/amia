      "0": "This diamond is a sphere of perfect proportions. Rather, it is two half-spheres carefully cut and fused together with no small amount of painstaking magic. Inside, it is cunningly carved and etched so that a central area is devoid of stone, and conic rays spread out, as though a small sun is within. When light catches it, a thousand thousand prismatic rainbows glint against the diamond cover that has been designed to protect the globe from any scratching or chipping and it seems to emit an inner light of its own which is only amplified by the careful cutting.\n\nThe topaz is cut into similar, but much less-substantial dual half-spheres. Its inner face is smooth, and designed with two symbols, one on each side. On the top half-sphere, a painfully exact replica of the sunburst of Lathander is scribed, with different crosscutting and stippling to denote different depths and textures within the etching. The reverse half-sphere holds an odd symbol; the setting sun of Labelas Enoreth superimposed with a star, symbol of Sehanine Moonbow, denoting the faith of the gem's crafter."
