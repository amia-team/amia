For years, Amia has established a rather remarkable bond with the various incoming strangers, seeking to start life anew in this faraway sanctuary.  However, one must trace the roots of Cordor to get the clearer picture.\n\nThe city of Cordor, like all cities, was once but a small village, nestled along a quiet strip of shoreline on the southern coast of the isle of Amia.  A hearty stock of human fishermen maintained the town, and a strong sense of pride was present among the citizens.  When a wrecked and battered ship careened into the harbor one day, the fate of Cordor, and all of Amia would be changed forever.  This was the first boat of refugees to find Cordor's port.  Eagerly, the townsfolk took in these haggard peoples, integrating them into their own.  It was this first generation that literally carved out the rugged land with roads and settled the largest island, Amia. \n\nStrangely enough, more boats arrived on the docks in the coming years.  All bearing refugees, outcasts and misfits that somehow fit into the populace in one way or another (The ones that were too much trouble were regularly refused passage on the islands and turned away).  This integration led to a rather widespread acceptance of many varied races within Cordor.  To this day, it is not unusual for a Cordorite to regard a drow, stray kobold or goblin with a degree of tolerance (providing of course, they present no sign of threat or hostility).\n\nIn it's early days, Cordor suffered from a great plague, which still has not been completely erradicated.  Those that were afflicted found death soon, but also undeath soon after.  Cordor maintains a graveyard at it's south end to hold these beloved, yet damned victims.  Although it's not uncommon for them to rise, seeking the living flesh of whoever comes too close....\n"
