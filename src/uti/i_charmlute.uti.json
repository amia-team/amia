      "0": "Arion's lute was crafted from the wood of an aged yew tree.  This tree, having lived its entire life atop the highest hill over the Nexus Falls, watched every sun rise in the east and settle in the west and every moon move like a lord among the lesser stars.\n\nAt dust one evening in the Year of the Burning Hand, a free range lamb, young and innocent and lost from the flock, took shelter beneath the yew.\n\nThen the impossible occurred - the yew tree, ever the ward against the hand of Talos - was struck down by a bolt of lightning in its prime.  It toppled, killing the sleeping lamb instantly.\n\nArion happened upon these remains and from them crafted a fine lute from the pliable wood that had seen the continuum countless times.  The strings he made from the eunuched lamb, both victim and sacrifice in his eyes.\n\nThis lute boasts ornate detailing in ivory and onyx, oppositional colors whose polarity is softened by the wood finishes' rich tones of golden earth.  The tuning keys along the neck are cast in alternating brass and silver; the sun rises in C, reaches a zenith in D, sets in E, followed by stars in F, a crescent moon in G, a half moon in A, and a full moon in B.\n\nArion humbly does not consider the instrument a gift from Labelas; only his talent and dedication, given to him by the Sage at Sunset.\n"
