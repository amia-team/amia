At one point, the isle was so devoid of enchanted items, that any such find was considered valuable, and magic items were hoarded by the dozens.  Then the Thayvians saw their advantage arise.\n\nSending out a far-flung diplomat to Amia upon hearing of the islands, the Red Wizards made a stunning deal with Cordor (and eventually many of the other cities and towns in Amia as well) to provide enchanted items and portals in exchange for not only large amounts of gold, but life-essence as well.  \n\nLittle is known of what the life-essence is used for, nor where and how they store it.  The Red Wizards remain tight lipped about this always, but it is assumed to be used in some sort of bizzarre magical experiment.\n"
