Governments usually only put up token resistance to the Thayvians at best, for it's in their interests to tax the Thayvians to support city coffers.  In fact, many of the additions to the cities of Amia can be traced to money acquired from the Thayvian Enclaves.\n\nThere are of course, those that are morally offended by the Thayvians.  Famous the world over for their aggressiveness in trade, racial rights violations and mysterious motivations, some folk take to never trading with the Thayvians.  Paladins and sometimes zealous clerics may outright confront the Thayvians as well sometimes, which does no good, as the Red Wizards are protected under local law to legally sell their wares.\n\nThere is most certainly a wide range of acceptance and rejection in the hearts of the people over the Thayvians.  Morality aside, the Thayvians have amassed a small fortune out of Amia due to their cornering of most of the weapons market, and they only appear to be growing in influence.  \n"
