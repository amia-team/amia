Simply reading the text brings a hint of chivalry to them as they remind themselves of their duties.\n\n1. Devote yourself to life. If there is any way to prevent death and preserve life, it is the way of a Paladin. \n2. Judge not others. By judging others, you yourself are judged. \n3. Honor your words and live by them. Your oath is as true as these laws. \n4. Help others live a full life, and harm not the harmless. \n5. Help those in misfortune, for gold is valueless next to life. \n6. Heal the sick and wounded who ask for assistance. Those whom you have deathlessly defeated remain your responsiblity. \n7. Abandon all greed, hatred, and evil feelings towards others. These close the mind to truth and engender a hatred for life. \n8. Pay homage to life by living freely and allowing others the same. \n9. Respect those who would teach you and ask nothing of those you teach. \n10. Respect the laws of mortals,but remember always that your fealty is to the laws of your Faith. \n11. Pledge your life, soul, and word to your Faith. Never should you worship another and never should your faith falter. \n12. Not Pride, Humility. Not Greed, Generosity. Not Envy, Love. Not Wrath, Kindness. Not Lust, Temperance. Not Gluttony, Moderation. Not Sloth, Zeal Never Evil, always Good. Bring light to the darkness and you shall always be counted among your Faith's blessed. \n13. Wear the symbol of your Faith with Honor, Love, and Devotion. Never rape, steal, or murder. \n14. Take only what you need, and give only what you can. \n15. The Undead deserve only their rest. Destroy them without hesitation."
