The rich lexicon of pirates.\n\nTo be honest you don't need to say anything stupid. We don't walk people off the plank, we don't call anyone a landlubber and I've certainally never seen someone keel-hauled.\n\nNone the less, piracy demands a certain 'flair' to be considered being a real pirate. In the company of 'lubbers', it's suggested you use as much foul language and simplistic grunts as you can manage, this puts them at ease and makes them feel as if their part of the team.\n\nIf at all possible, dress the part. Bandanas or stupid hats are encouraged. Wear gaudy jewelry, if possible, put out an eye. The most important part is to be creative! With liberal application of threats and grunts and a penchant for telling impossible tales, you too can be a feared scruvy sea dog, arrr!"
