It ends with two cities that are of partcular interest.\n\n-Udos Dru'Xon\nThe city in which most of the inhabitants of Ultrinnan came from, this city strongly followed the ways of Llolth and was run entirely by the matron of the first house.  Less than 1% of the population were slaves, 5% were travelers, and the remaining 94% were entirely Drow.\n\n-Ultrinnan\nAfter Udos Dru'Xon was destroyed, Ultrinnan was constructed deeper into the Underdark. Most of the residents in this city were survivors from Udos Dru'Xon. This city still serves Llolth without question and the city is now run by a council, similar to Menzoberranzan instead of ruled by one individual.\n\n[See the Ingame Books Content thread in the Libraries of Amia for more information]"
