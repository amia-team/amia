      "0": "Ghaunaduar is even less known than Eilistraee. His nickname is That Which Lurks. He is unpredictable. When he appears he is seen as purplish ooze with tentacles. His \"followers\" are mostly drow that have fallen from the grace of Lloth or sub intelligent monsters. He has been known to aid followers that just talk highly of his eminence. The chances of his coming, when called, rise if blood has recently been spilled. All that is required of his priesthood is a steady supply of sacrifices. Aid given by Ghaunaduar is usually in the form of combat effectiveness and regenerative healing of harms.  \n\n[See the Ingame Books Content thread in the Libraries of Amia for more information]"
