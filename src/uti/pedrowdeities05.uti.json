      "0": "Selvetarm is the embodiment of the drow passion for prowess in fighting, and the champion of Lolth. He is cruel and malicious by nature, and  cares only for battle and destruction. The Champion of Lolth harbours a deep hatred for all living things, including his dominating mistress, and the only beauty he can appreciate is a well-honed and deadly fighting style. Selvetarm can exhibit a great deal of patience while waiting for prey to fall into an ambush he has set, but he prefers the wild abandon of battle frenzy to a careful and deliberate attack.  He is the result of a short lived union between Vhaerun and Zandlar the Dancer. For a time he wandered alone and then became drawn to his aunt, Eilistraee. However this exploration of good ended when  Lolth drew him into her evil plots.\n\n[See the Ingame Books Content thread in the Libraries of Amia for more information]"
