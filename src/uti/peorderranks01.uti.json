      "0": "Order of Ranks in a Lolth Drow Society:\n\nNo rank should be considered permanent. In Drow society, a member may hold a rank for centuries but then fall to the knife of a rival or the inexplicable 'Will of Lolth'. There is no IC reason to assume that your title will be yours for the life of your character. Most ascension to power will require the approval of matrons and other high ranking drow. Demotions may come suddenly and from apparently nowhere.\n\nThe order in which females are considered of the highest rank and honor are as follows:\n\nMatron Mother of the First House\n\nFirst Daughter of the First House\n\nDaughters in order of birth of the First House\n\nMistress of Arach-Tinilith of the First House\n\nHigh Priestess of the First House\n\nPriestess of the First House\n\nTraining Priestess of the First House\n\nThe same order, starting for the Second House, and every order of Houses following to the n-th. (The first n Houses' Matron Mothers sit on a ruling council that tends to plot, scheme and govern in order to sway the happenings of the city.)\n\nThe order in which males are considered of the highest rank and honor are as follows:\n\nArchmage of their given city\n\nMaster of Sorcere/Master of Melee-Magthere\n\nElderboy of the First House\n\nSecondboy of the First House\n\nHouse Mage/House Weapons Master of the First House\n\nStudent of Sorcere/Student of Melee-Magthere\n\nFew ranks allow a male to stand out in the drow's female-dominant society.\nA female rank will always be higher than the highest male rank. While the rank of Archmage is the highest, most honored rank for a male, he must always pay respect to the females of his race.\n\n\n\n\n"
