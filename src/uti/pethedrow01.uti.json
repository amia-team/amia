We are the Drow, the masters of the Underdark. Eons ago, we once danced under the light of the sun and moon. We were once surfacers, once elves. A faction of Lolth worshiping elves were banished to the depths of the earth by their surface cousins. There in the lightless caverns they grew and taught themselves magic. Their skin was turned black as night and there hair white as spider silk as a reminder for the treachery they had commited. They grew and became strong. Although they could easily defeat there old time foes and reclaim the surface world, they no longer desired to walk among the trees. Their home was the Underdark, countless miles of caverns and tunnels deep in the earth. Ruled by powerful Matron mothers the Drow grew and made countless raids on the surface world. \n"
