The warriors are among the finest bladesmasters in all the realms. Drow warriors favor fast, light weapons that can be coated with poison. They also train with bows and crossbows. Maces are seen as sluggish and useless in battle. No self respecting warrior would train with them. \n\nComplex battle tactics are carefully studied and practiced in Melee-Magthere and all warriors must learn how to effectively lead in combat. Without the Sargtlinen of the House to fight the Matron's battles, there would be no foundation for power. \n\nThe warriors form the main body of the Drow army. The Drow are true friends to none, and the list of enemies of a house grows quickly. Usually an unseen dagger or a particular incantion is preferred, but when subtlety is no longer an issue, the troops are sent forth to make an empathic statement.\n"
