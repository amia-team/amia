Grieve's herbal reports it is used to keep witches from the stables, probably because of its blue color.\n\nStavesacre, especially the tall variety, is a significant cause of cattle poisoning on rangelands in western Amia. It is more common in high-elevation areas, and many farmers will delay moving cattle onto such ranges until late summer when the toxicity of the plants is reduced.\""
