His advice was simple. \nIf you eat a herb and it kills you then don't eat it again.\nHis advice stood him in good stead throughout his life until he was eaten by a wild bear whose supply of wild berries he was harvesting.\nNonetheless his advice has merit. Unfamiliar plants may well have healing properties but eating large quantities is unadvisable until such properties are known. Nibbling a corner of a leaf is a safer option than eating a bush to find out what it does."
