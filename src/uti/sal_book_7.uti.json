Learned by the most junior of clerics it is a gift of the Goddess which permits the performance of surgery without pain to the patient.\nIt should be noted however that although clerics learn this spell early in their training it is more advisable for a very senior cleric to cast the spell in cases where the surgery is likely to take more than a few minutes. \nIt must also be noted that certain people are extremely resistant to the spell. Preparation of spells to sap the will may prove helpful in allowing a subsequent Sleep spell to take effect.\n \nIf all else fails ask the patient to chew Pipe Herbs. Thereafter a Salandran Hammer applied skilfully to the back of the head is guaranteed to anaesthetise even the sturdiest of patients."
