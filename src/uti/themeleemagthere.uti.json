      "0": "The Drow's constant warfare on the surface and throughout the Underdark has bred a fierce race of elves. The warriors are among the finest bladesmasters in all the realms. Drow warriors favor fast and light weapons, that can be coated with poison. Crossbows and bows are also trained in. Maces are seen as sluggish and useless in battle. No self respecting warrior would train in them. \n\nThe complex tactics in battle are carefully studied and practiced among the Melee-Magthere, and all warriors must learn how to effectively lead in combat. Without the Sargtlin of the House to fight the Matron's battles, there would be no foundation for power. \n\nThe warriors form the main body of the Drow army. The Drow are true friends to none, and the list of enemies of a house grows quickly. There are times when a unseen dagger or a particular incantion is preferred, but when subtlety is no longer an issue, the troops are sent forth to make an empathic statement.\n"
