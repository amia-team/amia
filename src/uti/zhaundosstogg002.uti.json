While we ate the ashes of our kin because we were starving, while we cowered in the darkness of the pits below...the Elves drank their wine; the Humans skipped around like children! We suffered while they played, uncaringly, uncompassionately! Yet now, on our rise to greatness, the masked god wants us to raise the lesser creatures with us!? Nau! Let them rot, let them know what suffering means, it is us that know the definition of the word the most, we lived through the horrors, and WE survived because we did not lower our standards or settle for less than the strongest, the most powerful, or the best! To turn to Vhaeraun's ways would threaten everything we've lived and died for!\n"
