      "0": "Abjuration; An overview. \nBy Vito Corvus.\n\nThe School of Abjuration focuses upon protective magic. To Abjure is to remove, to dispel, to renounce or to banish. It can be used to create intricate weaves of protective spells, and it can be used to unravel them. Abjurations can create physical or magical barriers, negate magical or physical abilities, harm trespassers, or even banish the subject of the spell to another plane of existence. These spells most often interact directly or indirectly with other magics. \n\nAbjuration is a delicate magic which, with mastery, becomes incredibly potent. There is no doubt in my mind that a wizard who can find mastery in the art of Abjuration, can find himself in a position of mastery over all magics he encounters. \n\nDue to the nature of Abjuration spells and their relationship to other magics, an Abjurer needs to have a solid understanding of all other schools of magic, and alternative magics. Without this critical knowledge of how other magics operate, dispelling, countering and most Abjuration becomes much more difficult. It is not that the spells are harder to cast, but that their design and outcome lack a certain quality. It is for this reason, I have argued, that true mastery of the arts of Abjuration will arise in those wizards who take a holistic approach to magic; known amongst our circles as 'generalists'. These arguments are covered in other papers. \n\nAbjuration tends to appeal to particular types of spellcasters; critical thinkers, problem solvers, and people who act with deliberate intent and reasoning. Unlike others, who may be reckless or wasteful with their magics, an Abjurer would be conscious of his magic and the impact it has upon the world. Some have argued in the past, most notably Elminster the Sage, that Abjurers are held to a higher standard of conduct and ability because of the thinking patterns and methods of learning involved with their magic. \n\nIf you enjoy puzzles, picking apart the smallest of threads to find which to pull, or solving the universal mysteries of magic; Abjuration is the school for you!"
