The book contains many passages of lore and helpful surgical diagrams and charts relating to its topic, the basic information boiling down to the following.\n\nA Healers guide to Necrotic Cysts\n\n\nA Necorotic Cystic is a foul cancerous mass of necrotic energy that allows a one who willingly hosts a mother Cyst to wield any number of dangerous magics linked to necrotic Cyst growths. A Cyst may appear as a discoloration below the skin but they can buried deep enough in the body that there is no apparent evidence of such an infection. A Necrotic Cyst other then the mother Cyst is created magicaly with in another body by way of black magic. Once the Cyst has taken the victim becomes weaker against necrotic magic and may now be effected by Cyst related black magic.\n\nInfection\nThe Mother Cyst can only be formed by way of black arts and dark rites, infected lesser Cysts are created in the bodies of others by one with a mother Cyst using dark magic that can be resisted. \n\n\nIdentification\nThere are two methods to finding Necrotic Cysts, one is a through search of the persons body looking for discolorations in the flesh if said coloration is sensitive to pain it is likely a Cyst. The Second method is a simple Detect Magic Cantrip. Being instilled into the victim by way of a spell the Cyst radiates a necrotic Aura from with in the victims body. A mother Cyst can only be detected by the first method and removing such is moot as the magic can simply grow a new Cyst.\n\nRemoval\nNo magic can remove a Necrotic Cyst once it has taken in a host, the only method of removal is with a blade and a steady hand. The Cyst once found must be carefully extracted from the victims flesh. It is recommended once the Cyst is removed to burn and or otherwise destroy it. It should also be noted failure to properly cut out the Cyst has been known to cause excessive bleeding and death in most subjects."
