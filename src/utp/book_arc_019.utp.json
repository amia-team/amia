These words are written in intention of appreciation of the support\nfreely given to another practitioner of the Art. Placing their own time and\neffort in guiding me to the correct path without necessarily knowing the \ninput you gave to my path as a Wizard. Truly have I been blessed by the \nSeldarine to have such individuals aid and deep insight shedding the darkness,\nremoving the shrouds of mystery before my eyes. At the beginning of my \nwork, I considered this research work to result in increasing my understanding\nand in the end giving me complete understanding of the Weave. Now as I look\nback at my ambitions, I can not feel more amused to the thought of that, to \nunderstand the Weave is alone the task of Lady of Mysteries. I may collect my \nresearch and write a book to demonstrate my knowledge of specific areas, but \nyou would be living in an illusion to believe I know or understand the Weave \nany better than you. What I have is simply more experiences with it and ever \ngrowing number of questions. I do not mind this, the fact I will never fully \nunderstand the Weave or Lady of Mysteries, for the two are the same. I merely\nenjoy exploring the potentials of the Weave and at the same time disseminating\nmy information to you, dear readers and colleagues of the Art. In hopes that \nsomeday my work would inspire you to research and develop the Art. \n\nIn the end there is not much to say other than: Thank you dear colleagues.\" \n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nForewords\n\nThe content of this tome tries to achieve unbiased look into the forms of magic the researcher has ran into during the multiple \nresearch projects conducted. The sole aim of the text to inform the possible readers and to have for the future researchers a \nbase of research where they can start from. The pure intention of the text is to inspire one to further research the Art, however,\nfocusing more to the Traditional Magic and to warn of the dangers of the Nontraditional Magic and to prepare them to deal with the\npractitioners of it. This study is heavily based on the Art, not studying the depths of the Power, as such, the research is obviously\nlimited and it is recommended for following research to widen the scope of research. \n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nFundamentals of the Art\n\nIn Amia, we seem to be constantly surrounded by various practitioners of magic. The differences varying in the gestures of arcane, in the way of\npronouncing the words vary between each caster, yet there are facts that cover all the casters. In order to utilize the Art, it either needs to \nhave been learned or to be innate affinity to it, having been born with with the gift that is the Art. \n\nMost often the practitioners of the Art have come through long time of studies of the fundamentals of the Art, by learning the delicate manner of\ndrawing formulas, having been learning to analyse others spell formulas and most importantly long hours in study reading and practicing somatic,\npronouncing the words that trigger the formulated magic into taking the course intended. For them the Art is of careful study, analyzing aspects \nof it and finding what are the foundations behind the spells that formulate specific occurrences in the spell. Work hours spend in mastering the\nspells every aspect in order to fashion it to the desired effect. \n\nHowever, the preparations of the wizards are the lengthiest and complex part of their Art. For hasty work will only end up the energies escaping \nbetween the casters fingers like sand. Unstructured, unusable and a waste of time. Preparing is the most important part of any wizards desire to \nactually cast the spell. The preparation itself does not consume any of the potential of the wizard with the Art, merely acts as a measure for the \npotential for the spell prepared. \n\nTo look at the other side, nowadays, most commonly represented are those to who the Art come naturally, often depicted as part of their very\nbeing. Certainly we can not outright decline the fact that these people learn Art mere intuition, in some cases with some training to perfect\ntheir casting styles. Those born with the spontaneous casting ability to utilize the Art, is this a result of societies lengthy exposure to the Art, \nwhich eventually has started it being natural part of our children? Even though what might be the case, these individuals with the gift of Art\nstemming from within them seem to ignore the wizards most important step to cast spells, preparations. However, boon comes with a price, most\noften the spontaneous casters tend to have less options within their grasps, even though having more potential to cast the narrow range of spells\nwith greater number of times. \n\nIrrelevant to the way an individual approaches the casting of spells itself, prepared or readied, the caster themselves choose when they desire \nto trigger the spell, more often called as casting of a spell. Casting of a spell is another complex matter, some spells require several specific\nparts in order to be casted, such as components which can range from very mundane piece of grass to a large expensive mirror or a specific \ngesture within the spell formula at the right time or a very precisely pronounced word to finally release the arcane energies in desired fashion. \n\nEven we, the mages, wonder often as to why there are particularly so many different kind of components. After long considerations, they \nare in a sense locks that oversee that the spells act accordingly to the laws of magic established by the Gods and most importantly by the \nLady herself. Nonetheless, more often the ability to weave the Art into spells is simply spellbinding event, even the most respectable and \nresponsible mages can't deny the rush they receive when casting spells. However, with this Gift many have lost themselves and riveted to\nthe sense of power they receive, anyone seeking to master the gift of Art should do so with caution, for mastery over your area comes \nwith a price. \n\nTerminology\n\nThe Weave\nFor many it is a mystery what exactly the Weave is. In general all creatures have their print on the Weave, The Weave touches Faerun and is \npart of it, it exists in most places. It is present in each living creature and nonliving as well as present in the very ground itself.The Weave is \noften used by all casters, however, more commonly referred to by the practitioners of the Art rather than by those of the Power. The Weave \ncan be considered a gateway to magic, build and overseen by Lady herself, Mystra. In the current times the Weave often requires certain keys\nto unlock the magic behind the spells, such as the gestures, wordings and components. Through the Weave the spellcasters can access magic \nwith less risk than accessing directly to raw arcane energies. We could consider it a safe mechanism placed by the Lady to keep those who use \nit safe. As said, the Weave exists in almost all placed, but there are exceptions to this rule as well, for dead magic zones, anti-magic areas or \nwild magic zones are slightly different. In areas of anti-magic, the Weave is not destroyed, merely temporarily blocked or removed, within these\nareas none can connect to the Weave. These kind of areas can be created via spells and other methods, however, they can as well be cancelled.\nThe dead magic zones are locations where the the flow of the Weave has been so greatly damaged that it no longer is present or accessible. \nOnly few know how to correct these areas and the task is arduous to say the least, however, usually these areas are not large in scale and size.\nThe Wild Magic areas are location where the flow of Weave has been severed or damaged, the Weave is present but broken. In these areas the\nmagic works in unexpected ways and great care should be taken to cast spell within such areas. \n\nThe Art\nWhen the magic does not come from deities, it falls under the term 'The Art'. The Art is used by many, such as commonly known wizards, sorcerers,\nbard, but as well by assassins and harpers for example. Not many understand that the source is the same for their magic, but such is the case. It \nmust be noted that here as well lie exceptions, but those are very special cases. Those who use the Art have either trained to have the competences\nto wield and unlock the secrets of the Weave or it comes to them naturally. By using the Weave, the casters bend the Weave and use the keys of \nspells to unlock the potential of the magic fashioned.\n\nThe Power\nWhen magic comes from the deities themselves, it is called by term 'The Power'. The term indicates to divine magic which is accessed by prayers. \nThis is rather uncommon term among many places, for not many understand that the magic they wield comes from the Weave. Often living under \nillusion that the deities give this magic and not coming from the Weave. Regardless to wielders believes of the origins of their magic, the most \ncommon practitioners of this magic are priests, clerics, paladins, blackguards and druids. These casters do not study their magic and prepare it, \nbut it is considered a reward by their deities for their prayers and worship. \n\nTitles\nWizard\nThis term can be used of persons who are either specialized wizards, see bellow, or non-specialized wizards known as generalists. However, if a \nwizard is known to specialize or favor certain school of magic, the proper specialist title is used. All wizards study the Weave and the Art to better\ntheir abilities with it, some for noble causes and others for sinister causes. A majority of their work involves studying spell formulas, knowledge\navailable of the Art and creating theories and developing spells. \n\nSorcerer\nThese people are descendants of unoriginal source of power. The magic flows in their blood thicker and through this connection can manifest \nnumber or spells. There are many sources where a person can have their sorcerous abilities stemming from, a dragon, fey, celestial, fiendish\nancestor within their family lineage. Most often sorcerers are born to families who work closely with the Art, it is suspected that this exposure\nleads to innate abilities with the new born. Often sorcerers are shunned for their volatile nature as the Art reacts and lives with them, however,\nwith proper guidance a sorcerer can learn to control their use of the Art. \n\nSpecialist\nSpecialist refers to a person who has chosen a school of magic to specialize in. Each school of magic has their own term for a specialized wizard.\nIn short such are: Abjuror, Conjuror, Evoker, Necromancer, Diviner, Illusionist, Transmuter, Enchanter\n\nArcanist\nAny person with ability to cast and wield arcane spells. This term can be, therefore, be used of bards, assassins and harpers as well. It is considered\nto be a synonym for 'arcane spellcaster'. \n\nMage\nA person with ability to wield arcane spells. The difference between a mage and arcanist is that the former's primary talent lies with the Art.\n\nArchmage\nThis title is used when referring to a person with notable understanding of their field or the Art in general. A person who has dedicated their live\nto further their understanding of the Art and those around them. During their career having accomplished tasks beyond of most mages. \n\nThe Art of Protection\n\nThe School of Abjuration, the school of defensive magic. Few can argue the usability of this school and it's \nmagic, and ever fewer deny the use of it. Perhaps not seen as most powerful of the schools of magic,\nhowever, who would give up the protection offered by the schools spells. Those specializing in abjuration\nschool are known as abjuror's, these specialized mages have the strongest protective spells of all the \nmages. The spells of abjuration school can create wards protecting from strikes of your enemies and\nnegate hostile magic targeted upon you. Within this school lies the power to dismiss enemies to their \noriginal planes or called and summoned creatures, it as well can remove curses placed by other forms of\nmagic. For an abjuror the fundamental understanding lies in understanding how magic functions and what\nmeasures can be taken to counter it. Even for number of effects that can be created by abjuration school\nof magic, the beauty of it lies in its simplicity. Few of it's most powerful spells simply override almost all\nhostile spells and ward from physical harm. Abjurors are often known for their ability to recognize spells\nand counter them via action called counterspelling. A well prepared abjuror can easily counter all spells \nof a hostile mage. Not only does the abjuror benefit from the chosen form of magic, but those traveling\nwith an abjuror can experience the benefit of having one. Their ability to ward comrades from harmful \neffects is often found a boon in challenging situations, not to mention the ability to counterspell an enemy\nmage. Highly valued member of a group, due to the ability to protect its members. Weakness of the school,\nhowever, lies in the inability to cast offensive spells to end a fight, therefore an abjuror requires other \nschools of magic or comrades to complete the work. Even for the shcools apparent weakness, it still can not\nbe said to be a weak school of magic. To determine power of a school of magic only based on the offensive\nability would be foolish. Without abjuration magic, there are left only few if any spells to shield oneself\nfrom offensive magic. The ability to shield ones body, mind and soul can not be underestimated. Even for\nabjurors standing in a group lies within support position, it would be naive to consider keeping an abjuror\nfrom the point of hostilities. When an abjuror is present, they can focus their attention in shielding their \nallies and creating protective fields, negating the enemy's advances, therefore a tactician should note a good\npositioning for an abjuror. To be certain if the point of abjuration went missing, abjuration protects. \n\nDefensive Warding\n\nWhen considering the school of abjuration, it is easiest to start with protecting from physical harm. Some\nspells of abjuration grant the bearer an shield of force that often can be overlooked by naked eye, yet it's\naugment for protection cannot be denied. A sword swung at your vital spot halted by the field of force\nbetween you and the cold steel, might just be what is needed to protect you. Likewise, the abjuration\nschool can provide other forms of shields upon the bearer, most commonly known is the stoneskin spell\nthat creates a layer of stone upon the armor. Not hindering your movement, but reducing the amount of \ndamage caused by physical attacks of an enemy. Abjurative magic can as well create forcefields designed \nfor defense, fields that shield from enemy ranged attacks such as arrows or even worse, offensive spells.\nFields such as spell mantles that simply negate the targeted offensive spell. In the end, the power of the\nschool of abjuration lies much upon the shoulders of the mages utilizing it. Ability to determine what would \nbe the offensive actions coming and then countering them in the best possible way. Much of the abilities of\nabjuration school can be considered 'borrowing' from other schools. Creating a force field is of the school \nof evocation, transforming skin of an creature stone-hard is transmutation and banishing creatures could be\nconsidered conjuration school. However, the school of abjuration 'borrows' ideas from other schools and the\nonly school to create those ideas as forms of defenses. And the school of abjuration has form of effect only\nbeing able to be created through it: Anti-magic. \n\nAnti-magic\n\nThe only school to that works as anti-magic is abjuration school of magic. To negate or to suppress magic \nbelongs under abjuration, in any and all of its forms. This ability of the abjuration schools is often used in\ncreation of prisons to keep magically gifted creatures inside, to suppress their abilities and render the\nconnection to the Weave. Anti-magic itself can be divided into two forms, dispelling and continuous. Dispelling\nanti-magic aims to end the spells in contact, whether they are as wards such as spell mantle or as targeted\ndispelling spell such as Greater Dispelling. But it would be foolish to believe that dispelling will work each time,\nfor times the enemy caster might just be more powerful in maintaining their spells. Dispelling anti-magic often\nremains short period of times and are targeted. Continuous anti-magic are often fields under which magic or\nany magical ability are suppressed. These fields remain in the location they are created in and last longer than\ndispelling anti-magic. If a spell effect comes under anti-magic field it becomes suppressed and no longer \ngrants the effect intended, however, once leaving the anti-magic field the spell, if still duration lasting,\nre-establishes itself. However, the most potent and useful ability of anti-magic is the ability of counterspelling.\nA spell that never leaves the hands of an enemy caster, is the least dangerous spell.\n\nTheory of Conjuration\n\nThe School of Conjurations use vary to various parts, most commonly these are divided into five sub-schools within\nschool of Conjurative magic. A practitioner and mage that focuses in conjuration school is called conjurer by those \nwho recognize their training within it. Usually, when discussing of conjuration, the most common image is mages \nsummoning or calling creatures of mundane or extra planar origins. However, such is a vary narrow look into a school \nthat offers the most varied opportunities, such as: Teleportation, Creation, Summoning, Calling and Healing. However,\nit should be noted that healing is usually not utilized by arcane practitioners and thus it will be excluded from this study,\nuntil an arcane caster finds a way to simulate the effects or to create exact effects that the divine casters can. \n\nFor a conjuror, the spells they draw are based upon the leftover energies after the creation of the universe, to them the\ncreation is on-going process that they merely tap to fashion the effects and creatures they need and not actually taking\nanything real from the world around them. \n\nSub-Schools of Conjuration\n\nTeleportation\n\nSub-school of Conjuration: Teleportation works to transport objects or creatures over great distances. It is known that the\ncasters can travel short or long distances depending on the spells they utilize. Some spells even allowing traveling between\nthe planes. However, through extensive experimentation, it has come to realization that the more known the location of \nthe teleportation magic destined to, is, the easier it is to accurately teleport into the said location. \n\nWithin Amia region, Ruathym and some parts of the main land, the mages have learned to tap into so called Ley Lines, these\nancient formations allow traveling between several destinations by the use of portal wands that are attuned to particular user\nand upon activation allow the user to portal to, already visited and attuned, locations where the Ley Lines are closest to Toril.\nBy having tapped into this formation and its energies, the mages in these regions have enabled masses to travel between \nlocations with speed and numbers unlike elsewhere. \n\nCreation\n\nSub-school of Conjuration: Creation aims to fashion the arcane energies into forms designed, creating actual objects or \neffects on spot. Unlike summoning objects, creatures or effects from elsewhere, the magic of creation sub-school transforms \nthe fundamental arcane energies into the actual objects or effects on spot. By utilizing the sub-school creation, it is possible \nto create arcane shells of creatures and objects, which upon inspection appear similar to their real counterparts, yet are \nactually made of arcane energy. The arcane shells of living creatures created this way, do not act in any means similar than\ntheir living counterparts, they are empty arcane shells. However, extensive study has proven that these shells created through\ncreation school can be filled with other form of energy to be controlled and sharing the senses of the created being, an action\ncalled 'Dispensing'. \n\nCreation sub-school is as well used when creating pocket dimensions. By utilizing base of spell: Secret Chest, with some modifications\nit is possible to create pocket dimensions that with the use of spell permanency become permanent manifestations. Even though the\nSecret Chest is of sub-school of summoning, the modifications of the spell made it become part of the creation sub-school. It must\nbe noted that if the item holding the pocket dimension, such as a case of magical bags, the content of them is poured outside of them\nand destroying the pocket dimension within them. As well, it should be noted that never a bag of holding should be placed within another\nbag of holding. The theory of paradox of the two pocket dimensions is the fact that the both pocket dimensions are already existing within\nthe same plane, and thus they can't physically be placed inside one another, the laws of reality simply do not allow this action and will \nresult in destruction of the bags of holdings themselves. \n\n\n\nSummoning\n\nSub-School of Conjuration: Summoning allows the caster to manifest energies, creatures or objects to their immediate proximity.\nAs mentioned already, this sub-school tends to draw the entities, energies and objects elsewhere and unlike creation to actually\ncreate them. Often upon Amia, this sub-school is used by mages who summon forth various entities, for their luck it might be \nadded, as the creatures more often than not end to take the fighting instead of them. In cases of utilizing the Calling sub-school,\nthe creatures would more likely leave the caster, however, with summoning sub-school the entities are bound by the will of the\ncaster and the spell formula itself. Never summoning forth creatures should be taken as a light action, especially when it comes\nto the more potent creatures. The caster that prefer summoning sub-school over other are called summoners. \n\n\nCalling\n\nSub-school of Conjuration: Calling is used to transport entities from other planes of existence to the plane of the caster, an\naction that should not be taken lightly. By utilizing calling sub-school, the creatures are not bound by the caster, but can \neither agree to aid the caster or disagree and take their leave, in most fortunate cases. In some cases, depending on the \nnature of the called creature, they may simply assault the caster if defensive preparations have been left lacking. It is as \nwell possible to negotiate a price with the called creature for which they agree to do the deed or form a contract. \n\nThe Theory of Divination\n\nIntroduction\nSchool of Divination, often underestimated school of magic. Many do not seek the way of a diviner, for many\ndo not understand the true power of a diviner. Often overseen for the lack of power it gives to those who master\nit. And certainly it can be agreed that divinations do not destroy your enemies directly, move mountains nor\nchange material to another. But those who do the mistake of underestimating divinations are quite wrong of \nthe power it presents to proper mage. Divinations aim to reveal the hidden and seek it for you. Information \nis the game of a diviner, to know your enemies allows you to properly prepare and in great danger knowing\nthe target of your enemies can save life's. Even other schools of magic can not deny the usability of divination,\nfor what use is offensive evocation spell for an evoker, if they can not see their enemy. Ultimate use of the\ndivination school of magic lies with Power Word spells that can be used to seal the fate of an enemy. \n\nBasic of Divination\n\nDiviner\nA mage specializing into divination school of magic is called diviners. These mages potential in casting and \nsucceeding to reveal the unseen, unheard, lost or time is simply greater than that of a generalist wizard. \n\nSchool of Divination \nAs said the School of Divination is used to locating objects and person, finding information of objects, person\nand events, foiling the effects of deceiving spells or enhancing the visual and hearing properties, used to \nremove barriers of communication or understanding of written text. To foresee what is coming and to reveal\nwhat already has been. In the following chapters, the aim is to open more in depth the school of divination \npurposes and uses. The School of Divination often works on symphatetic links between objects and the caster.\nThese sympathetic links are referred to as 'bridges' in the arcane communities. When a divination spell of \nscrying or such as legend lore spell are cast the spell will first and foremost use the casters own bridges to \nconnect itself to the object of the caster. The larger this personal network of bridges is the larger are the \nchances to succeed at casting of the spell. In cases of casting scrying spell, the caster must have first-hand \nexperience of the target of their spell, otherwise the spell will fail. This is due to the lack of sympathetic link\nfor the spell to attach to and reveal the object. Therefore it is strongly recommended that a diviner spends \ngood time in seeing places and meeting people, creating stronger bridges between them and the object or \ntarget. Unlike scrying spells, the spells that gather information can work without this first-hand experience \nof the target, it certainly helps but is not a requisite. What happens is that the information gathering spells\nfirst use diviners own information as a base to create these bridges to gather information, if none, the spell \nwill start to work to connect secondary sources of information and collecting information via them. For example\na secondary source of information can be a location where the event took place, thus being there to cast the \nspell will help the spell to gather the wanted information. Most important for information gathering spells is \nthat the target of the spell is known, it means that it has been historically important enough for the spell to \nrecognize it. In some cases these targets may have been important enough, but as time passes, their value may\ndecrease as less and less know of them and thus the spell may fail. \n\nDivination school of magic can be used to augment senses of a person, hearing and seeing mainly. There are\nmany creatures in this world that are adept at hiding from sight and ear. When your own senses do not manage\nto reveal them, the spell will work to reveal them for you. When discussing of hidden enemies, in some \ncases information may be what is needed to foil your enemies plans, some spells of divination school seek\nto reveal this information for you. In these cases it is important that the diviner has done pre-casting work \nto enhance the potential of the spell. For often, the casters own information or established bridges can augment\nthe results of divination. In most cases it has been noted that a failure for a scrying spell to operate, usually \nmeans the target is protected from scrying or that there is something preventing such to take place. Defenses \nagainst divinations will be discussed later. To add to the utility of divination school, it may as well help to remove\nbarriers of communication between humanoids. Understanding speech or written text via spell, however, in rare\ncases these do not work. It might be that the written text could be protected from spells like this or that the\nperson targeted may not be influenced by a spell to help with communication. \n\n\nProtecting from Divination\n\nThere are several ways to protect from divinations. Such as placing wards to the locations to prevent scrying\nor placing wards on a person to prevent being scried. Some spells can protect a target from being known as\nwell, thus protected from information gathering spells. Some powerful entitiescan directly stop a divination\nfrom working and may it be noted, to use that bridge to counter diviners measures. A layer of led as well\nprotects from scrying. \n\n\nDangers of Divination\n\nIt would be foolish to consider using Divination spells without preparations; the illusion of safety is great \nwith this school. More often than not, the object of divination usually has defenses placed against scryings\nor even legend lore. Sometimes diviner may end up dealing with something greater than they expected, \nsuch as entities of great power which can launch direct backslash at the caster from a distance. These \nbackslashes vary from entity to another, but melting and exploding mirrors have taken place or a direct \nlaunch of power at the caster knocking them down or even unconscious for weeks. \n\nHere abjuration spells come to play; some spells may entirely prevent certain backslashes taking place or\nweaken them so the full force of the impact never reaches the caster. If the caster knows they are working\nwith an potent entity it helps the caster to identify the beings nature so that a proper Magic Circle against\nAlignment may be placed. A mindblank spell is a good start for protection. \n\nWhen dealing with normal humanoids, monsters or objects, there is a chance the creature can resist the \nattempt of being divined by strong enough mind, spell resistance, or defensive spells that prevent divination.\nDivination works well with Conjuration school as well, as the diviner is able to locate creatures and objects \nor to see the region beforehand, once this is done, teleport to the location, if there is nothing preventing the \ncaster. This being said the caster should note that if the target of divination knows of the caster, they are\nable to come to the caster as well. \n\nDivination Backslashes\n\nWhen casting divination spells there are number of backslashes that can occur, some entities have their own\ntrademarks even. Some backslashes may include equipment destruction such as the mirror exploding, getting\nshattered or melting and through this cause damage to the surroundings and the diviner. While some backslashes\nmay take place regardless of the casters actions, exhaustion is most common form of backslashes caused by\nsimply carrying out a divination spell. In some cases the price of casting might be ones spirit or soul becoming\nexhausted and thus greater time is needed for recovery. Most dangerous forms of divination backslashes are\ndivination causation. \n\nDivination Causation usually refers to situation where an entity of notable power is involved or gets involved and\nsees to punish the offender for scrying or gathering information they seek to protect. Potent entities are able to\nuse bridges created by the divination spells to enact their revenge for taking an offensive action. For casting a \ndivination upon another without their consent is, indeed, an act of violation of their privacy. Some entities can \npour a portion of their own energy through these bridges and place it within the diviner, it can and most of the \ntimes will result in illnesses or other manifestations. In other cases this bridge can be reversed to reveal the \ndiviner to the target entity, which then gathers information if the diviner does not realize what is taking place. \nThe entity may as well carry out a backslash of their own if they so choose. \n\nCase: The Living Silver\nBackslash: Pouring Raw Arcane Energy to the diviner\nSymptoms: The diviner received very high fever and eyes turned into silver orbs, it did not influence sight however.\nAny arcane spell cast upon the diviner increased the fewer and was noted that diviner casting spells decreased the \nfewer. Cooling baths were noted to decrease the fewer as well. In time the diviners movements started to become\nmore stiff and slower, the skin started to form silver spots.\nCure: The diviner was brought to anti-magic zone, where the silver poured outside. Tearing the diviners skin entirely \nand almost killing the diviner at instant. The liquid silver attempted to reform itself into a humanoid form, defying the\nanti-magic zone and almost collapsing it. After losing the battle against the potency of the anti-magic area, the form\nwas destroyed. \n\n\nRitual Divination\nBenefits of casting divination in ritual circle are multiple, much like with any other ritual casting, it \nincreases the chances of the casting actually working, ritual casting as well, in some cases decreases the\ntime required to learn the information and the information possibly is more accurate. Especially in cases \nof having potent magical artifact, it might be preferred to have a circle of mages casting divination ritual \nrather than working on it alone, for numerous safety reasons and likeness of being able to bypass its \npossible defenses. The key, like in any ritual casting, is to synchronize your spell casting with the other\nmages, arcane chanting and required gestures timed perfectly. Not only must you be able to time the \ncasting, but as well be able to connect to the other mages. Become one with others is always a challenge,\nhowever, having a common goal and interest combined with knowing the other mages aid tremendously.\n\nIn casting of divination ritual, the usual focuses of the mages are to increase the scope of the spell, by \nincreasing the potency of the spell to bypass defenses, to increase the range of the divination, to\ndecrease the time required to gather information, to name but a few. However, by multiplying the factors\nof the formula, or to decrease some, the arcane energy required to cast the spell successfully increase. In\norder to be successful with the casting, it is strongly recommended trained mages who can maintain their \nconcentration and maintain their channeling of energy. As the energies increase, the threat of more potent\nbackslash increase, it is a clear causal-relation between the two. \n\nTheory of Applicability of the Spell Formula \n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the following chapter the aim is to open creation of spell designs and the 'how' -approach for developing or \nmodifying spells. Most of the work was conducted by the researcher as a quasi-experimental research, which \nis the best approach for spell development. In most of the cases, at start, the researcher had only minor control\nof the process prior testing the spell. Quasi-experimental research aims to; first of all, gathering information \nrequired to develop the spell through careful research, secondly allow the research to follow and control the spell\nformulation towards desired end with less risk involved. By careful modification and controlled testing through \nquasi-experimental research to have a method which allows changes and development to be approached in logical\nmanner and knowing exactly what each modification in the change of factors does. The approach each mage\ntakes depends highly upon personal characteristics of the researcher, however, in many arcane communities at \nthe time, quasi-experimental approach is highly recommended. The core of this arcane development methods is \nnot purely experimentation per se, but rather the strategy connoted by phrase \"plausible rival hypothesis\".\n\nSpell Design\n\nWhen approaching spell design, it is important that the researcher has already prior determined and defined the\ndesired outcome of the spell. Logical approach is that when the desired spell outcome is known, it allows the \nresearch to have clarity of mind regarding the work and identify which already existing spells have those effects\nor are closest to those effects desired by their own spell formula. In spell design the desired spell effect is \nalready being converted into spell design which aims to solve how the spell effect or number of spell effects can\nbe designed and where there information can be collected. Do note that this phase is not about how you will \nconduct the research projects, but to defined where and what need to be done and how can it be done. Clarifying\nthe spell development process to be approached in more practical and \"hands on\" -approach. Connecting different\nvariables such as; links between the desired spell effect, existing spells and conclusions, in logical order. Please \ntake into consideration that spell design and research method are separated issues and there necessarily are no \nconnections between the two. Former, spell design, is to be considered as a subsidiary to the matter of \"What \nevidence do I need to collect?\". \n\nStages of Spell Design\n\nFirst stage of Spell Design is to have defined the desired spell outcome, what is the spell supposed or desired to do.\nFrom this point start the actual mapping of the spell design, listing what kind of information is required to create \nthe spell effect and secondly to list where such information could be found. For example if the researcher is planning\nto develop a fireball with wider radius than the common version allows, the information could be gathered from \nprimary information sources such as other spell formulas. When working with primary information sources, the aim \nis to identify spells that effect larger radius than fireball original formula. For this explanation the spell design will be\nkept simple, instead of including number of factors that all would require to be mapped. These can include such as:\nThe area of effect, intensity of the blast, duration of the explosion and so on. To expand the original fireball formula,\nexample could be taken from spells such could be Banishment spell or Light of Le'Quella spell which effect colossal\narea instead of large. If the research decides to consult other mages for their project, they are considered to be \nsecondary information sources. When the information sources needed is mapped, the next step is analysis, how does\nthe gathered information or lack of it, affect the analysis? Are there limitations? For example if information of the \ndesires spell effect is scarce, then the limitations could be the lack of information or references for the spell\nformulation process. It is imperative to understand what is being conducted and the scope of the work to understand\nwhat limitations the project might face. One of the most obvious limitations is access to the Weave, are there \nlimitations by the Lady of Mysteries or the skill and competence level of the researcher themselves. It would be waste\nof time and resources to carry on a spell design that clearly shows the researcher is not competent at this point to \neven get near succeeding. If learned that desired spell effect is out of reach due to any of the limitations, the researcher\nis placed back to rethink their desired spell effect. Otherwise they need to analyse how the limitations effect the \ndesired spell effect. \n\nAfter the required spell information is gathered and the possible sources mapped, the next step in spell design is to\ndefine \"How to collect information?\" and \"Which research techniques should be used?\". Some mage researchers find \nit important to keep their research processes less known and therefore would prefer more discreet methods of information\ngathering, such as locating primary information sources, tomes and spell scrolls. While others would prefer to include \nother mages to the process and open the intentions of their project and therefore would prefer to interview other mages \nknowledgeable in the field or ask them to be directly involved. Please note that quasi-experimental research is merely\none way of approaching a research project and other methods and techniques do exist. After having mapped the research\ntechniques the research need to again analyse the process and look for possible flaws in their spell design, what could\nbe important and what could slow down the process. This is to enable more efficient and streamlined way of working,\nto use available resources efficiently. After researcher sees the spell design as satisfactory the actual process of carrying\nit out can start. In this spell design the process of analyzing your findings at each step is important, at the same time\nit can be time-consuming and frustrating. On the bright side well thought spell design allows the researcher to defined \nclearly their concept and what needs to be done, thus leading to more clarified state of mind and approach to entire \nspell development process. \n\n\n\nSpell Development Cases\n\nCase: Instantaneous Growth of Le'Quella\n\nSchool of Magic: Transmutation\nCircle:\tWizard 3\nComponents:\tV, S, M\nRange:\tClose (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)\nTarget:\tOne living plant\nSaving Throw:\tFortitude negates\nSpell Resistance:\tYes\n\nMaterial Component: Part of the plant targeted. \n\nPhases of Spell Formulation \n\nIn the beginning to design the spell, attention should be paid to identifying the objectives desired by \nthe spell. For the spell Instantaneous Growth of Le'Quella, the spell intention was clear: To Enlarge living plants.\nAs the objective was clear, it was easy to look into the First Circle spell: Enlarge Person -formula. By utilizing\nexisting sources, it was easy to identify what parts of the spell formula influenced the growth process of the \nperson, where the energies tapped to pull the magic and guided to the already established routes to create \nthe desired effect. \n\nThe second step of the spell was to take samples of spells that influence objects, which can be found in numbers\nfrom transmutation school spells, as such it was a matter of time to learn how the First Circle spell: Enlarge Person\nshould be modified to influence the growth plants. By adjusting the factors influencing target and channeling the \nenergies in correct manner, without destroying the object itself by subjugating it to exceedingly large amount of \nenergy, or too small amounts of energies which would not have sustained the spell for long times, the ideal balance\nof arcane energy flow was discovered. \n\nIn the third stage, begun the testing process upon trees within Winya Ravana, to see that the spell actually worked,\nafter which minor adjustments were made to perfect the spell and to enable the Fifth Circle spell: Permanency to take\nplace with the developed spell. In the end, by adjusting the factors of the spell, it increased complexity of the formula\nso that in the end it was decided to be placed to be Third Circle spell: Instantaneous Growth of Le'Quella. The developed\nspell respects laws of traditional magic, anti-magic zones and disjunction spells and can be made permanent effect by\nthe use of Fifth Circle spell: Permanency. It as well can be casted as a circle spell by a circle of mages, as done within\nWinya Ravana. \n\nCase: Wild Creation, Shells\n\nSchool:\tConjuration, sub-school creation, Divination\nLevel: Wizard 1 - 9 \nComponents: V, S\nDescriptor:\tCreation\nRange: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)\nEffect:\tOne or several summoned creature shells\nDuration:\t1 round/level (D)\nSaving Throw:\tNone\nSpell Resistance:\tNo \n\nBy utilizing the gift of arcane to create pure arcane shells of creatures, similar to living creatures. The caster can create one\nor several creature shells, the options are endless. Tested shells have been that of aves, feline and canid animals. Once the\nshells have been created through utilizing conjuration subshool creation, the shells can then be filled with other form of energy.\nThis energy gives them quasi-sentience that actually the caster can fashion via installing a set of rules that the shells start \nto obey. By tapping into the connection, created by the energy, the caster can then share the senses of the creatures and even\ncontrol them to an extent. The smaller amount of shells there are, the greater is the control over the existing shells, a clear \ncausal connection between the two factors. If the arcane shells are installed with rules that the shells start to execute, such \nas a route they will go through, the caster can simply stand back and share their senses to gather information through their\nsenses such as smell, sight, taste, feeling and hearing. Allowing potent means of scouting large areas. To utilize this complex\nspell, the caster is required to have extensive understanding of conjuration shool, subschool creation especially and extensive\nunderstanding of divination shool. \n\n[The text seems vague of the nature of energy utilized to allow the shells react this way, it seems that by utilizing \nthis extensive formula is near impossible without having figured out the key ingredients left unmentioned in the text.] \n\nCase: Light of Le'Quella\n\nSchool:\tConjuration, sub-school creation\nLevel: Wizard 9 \nComponents: V, S\nDescriptor:\tFire, Positive, Light\nRange: Long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)\nArea of Effect:\tColossal \nEffect: Creates a pulsating ball of energy which area of effects diameter is 32 feet (16 each direction from center.) \n\nAs starting the developing of new spell, it is important to look into what already existing spells might execute\nwhat the caster is aiming for, thus the development of another spell would become waste of energy, resources \nand time. However, if there are no spells that create the desired effect, then it is beneficial to take a look into \nspells formulas that have components of the desired effects, as this will make the work easier and give an idea\nwhere to head from there. In the development of this spell, certain specific spell formulas were chosen as a base\nfor the spell, which through modification should conduct the desired effect as stated in the short description of\nthe spell. The chosen spells were following; Cantrip spell Light, First Circle spell Acid Bomb, Second Circle Spell \nCombust, Eight Circle spell Sun Burst. The idea was not to combine all the effects into one, but to look into the \nformulas and see what parts could help me to create the desired effects. \n\nThe developed spell should be able to create light, strong enough light to dispel magical darkness and natural, \nlight spell formula was ideal to look into as well as Sun Burst formula. The latter was as well used to find out \nwhat part of the spell formula is needed to cause the blindness effect as well as the spells ability to burst\ninstantaneously. Acid Bomb spell instead was looked into to learn what in the formula makes the energy to \ntake form of a sphere. As the Combust spell as such creates one of the desired effects, the formula only needs\nto be modified to work among the rest of the spell. As we have our chosen spells with some desired effects it \nis time to look into the formulas more thoroughly manner and discern which parts of the formulas cause the \neffects, in order to do this the spells will be gone through from lowest circle spell to the highest circle spell. \n\nPhases of Spell Formulation \n\nCantrip spell: Light\n\nFrom this captrip spell an experienced practitioner of the Art can detect how the formula works and what brings\nforth the light desired. Again the light takes form of a small ball, another implication to the sphere form desired,\nand how the spell channels arcane into light. My extracting the particles desired from the cantrip spell into yours\n, we can have solid base for creating light-effect and possibly implication to the sphere form-effect. \n\nSecond Circle Spell: Acid Bomb\n\nLooking into the second circle spell, it is clear that it has the sphere-form desired for the spell being developed. \nNow, as the circles get more complex so does the formulas and there is a clear. A clear correlation between the \ncomplexity and level of the spell is starting to show. Nonetheless, again with time and dedication combined with\npatience we are able to deduct the particles of the formula. If we start looking into it carefully, we can learn the\nparts that make the acid bomb take sphere-form, as well as how the elemental energy is fashioned into it. \n\nSecond Circle Spell: Combust\n\nAs the spell is one part of the entire spell, therefore wisest is to take it into account as it is and find a way to \nattach the effect into continues and periodical pulses of energy. Naturally however, as the main elemental is fire\nin the spell, combustion effect should not be hard to achieve, just requires small modifications with the formula.\n\nEight Circle Spell: Sun Burst\n\nIn the eight circle spell we have the desired binding effect along with light. Now due to the complexity of the spell\nand extensive formula, time and patience is needed to deduct the correct particles in it. Naturally those talented\nwith the spell and its school should have less of a challenge to find the parts. Important is to keep in mind what\nyou are searching for: Blindness- and light-effect of the spell. \n\nMoving forward it, as expected, took quite some time to find the parts, the cantrip spell: Light -formula study\nhelped in searching the light part, but the blindness-effect took more time. As the spell being developed aims\nto cause possible blindness to the victims, it can be taken as such, however, there is a clear need to tie it to \nthe formula similar to Combust spell, as continual and periodical -effect. \n\nNinth Circle: Light of Le'Quella\n\nAs we keep in mind the references found for the parts desired: Light, blinding, sphere-form, reference to acid \nelement drawing and combustion, we have rather solid base to start working the development of new spell. \nWhat is now needed is the modification of certain parts and developing rest of the desired effect: drawing \nelemental fire and positive energy with pulsating sphere as center. \n\nBy modifying the bright blinding light part into instantaneous and reoccurring part, we can have it flash in \neach pulse of energy. The sphere-form can be attained by creating stable dual energy portals that draw \nenergy straight from the plane of fire and plane of positive energy, if not radiation plane at the border regions\nof the two planes. By tapping into the planes itself and sucking energy through the portals, I should be able\nto create stable ball of light. When we modify the formula further, by adding periodical pulses, in theory it\nshould create the desired effect of ring of fire and positive energy to minor extent. However, here comes the\nchallenging part of modifying the combustion-effect into the ring of fire and successfully hitting the targets. \nIn theory, it should be applicable, to tie it into the pulses, however, extensive testing of the spell is required \nin order to find the correct means to do so. \n\nDisentangling the Sequence Process of the Spell Formula\n\nAs the spell developed takes few steps the text will be written in the order the effects take place\n\nFirst Sequence\n\nCaster speaks the phrasing of the spell accompanied with gestures in precise and practiced manner, casting \nthe spell, thus channeling the raw arcane energies into controllable form which fuels the spell formula that \nmake the raw energy to take form. \n\nSecond Sequence\n\nThe second stage utilizes the sphere form taken from Acid Bomb spell, thus creating a sphere of energy, the \nsphere as such is drawing energies from two planes, Plane of Fire and Plane of Positive energy, and as such it\nshould radiate bright light and heat. The desired effect of possibly blinding the victims first take place here, \nfrom Sunburst formula the instantaneous blindness effect takes place, as the sphere forms it should unleash a\nbright flash of light that can blind those with vision.\n\nThird Sequence\n\nThe sphere of energy starts pulsating periodically between certain time sequences, unleashing a ring of fire \noutwards from the center that is the sphere. As the sphere of fire catches those in its reach, which should be\n60 feet from the center to all directions, the victims would get burned by fire, and positive energy, and possible\ncatch on fire as in Combust spell. On each burst of fire, the sphere flashes again making those in its reach\npossibly blinded. However, for those with dexterous movement, it is possible to avoid the ring of fire and \ncombustion effect; naturally, some people are able to avoid the blinding effect as well. The spell however does\nnot respect spell resistance of creatures as it taps to the planes of energies, drawing the power directly from\nthem and such is not a created spell effect, but drawing actual pure energy. The spell is susceptible to dispel \nspells, anti-magic areas and dead magic zones\n\nThe All ~ The Power of Ostland\n\nVarious Jarldoms of Ruathym\n\nDuring period when Pimpant Magnus was the Jarl of Ostland and Lord Arsant Wiltun the second is listed as Chief Axe of All\nRuathym. Ruathmy region is a confederacy system with Jarls working under the Chief Axe and answering his decisions, all \nkingdoms being nominally independent. Civil war took place in Ostland as Ostland was in the way for Lord Arsant Wiltun for\nbecoming the Chief Axe. He won the civil war beheading the former Jarl and placing Pimpant Magnus on the throne of \nOstland, who was Lord Arsant Wiltun's lackey and ally.\n\nJarl Pimpant Magnus started purging all the nobles who had resisted Lord Arsant Wiltun and removing the Bathrie line entirely.\nBathrie women were sold as slaves to other Jarls to destroy the line and men were killed, none survived.\n\nThe Chief Axe, Lord Arsant Wiltun the Second received enormous political and economic influence and Ostland bathed in the \nblood of its people, the cities were ruined in the process. During the Civil War the trees carried miracluos fruits that prevented\nstarvation and famine of the war.\n\nThe feral druidic cult of Ostland called Treemasons vanished more recently, they were still active during the civil war.\n\nDruidic cults of the North, and my travels with them\nby Thaedaus Jorgeon, Edited by Lady Las'Claianna Le'Quella\n\nHistory\n\nBefore the dwarfen clan disappeared from Ostavhn, they had a home in there and with the help of humans they defeated\norcish horde. As a gift the dwarfs build them a castle that is today known as Ostudr. During these same times the former\nWar Knights current headquarters, Redgaarth was build as naval installation to be manned by the dwarfs. When the dwarfen \nhistory seems to stop, the Treemasons begin. The end of Dwarfen society came through an operation deviced by the Proudbear\nClan to return the Tremaasons dwarfs to the clan. However, the Treemasons eventually succeeded in turning the Proudbear\nClan members to Treemasons, by utilising and corrupting device called Proudbear's Cypher. In the end, the entirety of dwarfen\npopulation in Ostland became Treemasons. \n\nDuring the Civil War of the Ostland, the current time Anchor deviced a ritual of Salvation which would enable to richen the land\nand decrease famine in Ostland. In hopes to help the population that had became dear to the All. What was known was that \nthis ritual would be powerful enough to end the famine and rescue the civil population, yet leave the All suffering for losing the\nsource of iron it was using to sustain itself. Later on, without a quidance of Anchor, few of the remaining Treemasons did what \nthey could to help the All to sustain itself. \n\nSociety\n\nUnlike most enclaves of Dwarfs, the Treemasons were open minded and involved in the affairs of the humans. Residing in Ostland\nand even though otherwise like normal dwarfs, they were druids mainly. The Treemasons society involved obedience to the elder\ndruid, which were never observed speaking. These elder druids carried plant-like growths upon their bodies proudly; the more \nthere were the more status the person carried. Once every cycle season the cult held spiritual communions in order to communicate\nwith each other's and impart wisdom from these elders.\n\nUsually when first involved in feral druid cult the person is iniated and presented to the power, this power removes structure of the\nmind, such as languages and other structure that is set in civilized persons mind. The first iniation to the power usually is quite\npainful experience as the power removes harshly the barriers for its communication to the druid at hand. The power as well then \nplaces some of its own power into the druid, resulting that the power displaces the languages, social conduct or other important \nmatter what might define person 'civilized'. In recent years of raise of new Anchor, it was learned that these alterations can be \nremoved and changed, even furtherting the degree of influence to have total influence, establishing structures in mind that allows\nthe existance of 'civilized' information and the power of the All. \n\nThe alteration that took place in the druids can be either mental or physical alterations. Mental alterations usually made the person\nbecome more primal and feral, whereas physical alterations made the person look more part of the nature. The alterations will be\nexplored further later on the text. \n\nRituals\n\nRitual of Salvation\nIt seems that the ritual depleted the land from iron, as the Power uses sources of iron to fuel itself, now that it is depleted it required to\nfind a new source of iron to sustain itself. Thus the alteration of Miracle Seeds core's was done by Treemasons, which found the way as\ndelicacies in Oslands Court. The ritual was so powerful that the entire circle of Treemasons perished by casting it, joining the All. \n\nRitual of Communion\nThis ritual requires Anchor and two Protector caste members. By linking themselves through touch they are able to impart information to\neach other's, the Anchor deciding the energy consumption. If one of the Protectors are in weakened state, it will result in death, chosen \nby the Anchor. The use of this ritual will be far more safer in Ostland due to the entity being there.\n\nReligion\n\nThe Treemasons worshipped an entity known as the All, they believed it to be the real and true god of earth, soil and of life. It seems the \nThe All was fundamental part of them as they were of it.\n\nUsing the Power\n\nDepending on the amount of alterations made the druid had more power usually, thus the amount of power planted in them had more abilities\nand the druid could do more than let's say just one alteration had druid. The power was constantly with the druid and in their use, however,\nwithout contacting the All they could not fill the reserves they had, thus it could run out of power as well. Imagine a bowl of water you \nhave, you drink of it and in some point you must refill it. As the Power by very nature is chaotic being, using it might result in random alterations\ntaking place or by through using it will force alteration to be made as the use of it continues. Those who are of Protector caste, require to \nhave connection to an Anchor in annual basis, otherwise they are not able to sustain themselves. \n\nPossibilities with the Power:\n\nAlterations of Mind and Body\n\nDepending to the Power level of the person they can make these alterations into mind of body, even though Treemasons tended to have more\nprimal alterations, receding them back to let us say 'savages', which they weren't in the words true sense. It is also possible to alter these \nalterations back to normal or cause themselves to grow in size would they know how to do such. If the person is absorbed of power and the\nalterations are left, they will remain as natural part of the person.\n\nThe Mind alterations vary in strength, depending on the amount of power placed in the person, some of them were more notable and others so\nsubtle the closest persons to the altered person did not notice them instantly or at all. Due to the nature of these alterations becoming so\nmuch part of your own self, you might not notice them yourself either. Magical detection of these mind alterations, after the power has been \nabsorbed, is not possible as they are not magical in nature, but become part of the very blueprint. Difficulty in fixing any alteration is that if there\nis no reference, meaning the one making the alteration does not know how it was before, the one making the alteration works on gut feeling.\nIn one instance the alteration made resulted in switching the skin colors of the victim and the one doing the alteration so that they ended up \nwith each other's skins. Underneath is a list of alterations seen.\n\nMental Alterations:\nMind Alteration: Creation of Treemasons\nA new Anchor creating new Treemasons establishes a mindset to the target that will allow him to command the new Treemason. Even though \nTreemasons usually follow all the commands of Anchors due to their status, sometimes there might be need to impose their will over the lower \ncasts. This results in battle of mental capacity.\n\nMind Alteration: Desire\nPerson's sexual desires were enhanced\n\nMind Alteration: Metabolism\nPerson's started to have increased liking to red meat,\nwhen it was furthered only red meat could help their hunger.\n\nMind Alteration: Pain and Focus \nPerson experienced severe headache when getting closer to \nopposite power reserve, for example: the new Anchors alterations and Jarl's alterations. \n\nMind Alteration: Structure\nIn order for the All to communicate with its druids, it removed \nthe structure of the mind, which often are based on languages, or learned social behavior\nin society.\n\nMind Alteration: Duty\nPersons sense of duty overrides their free will, this has been used at\nleast one of the Everwatch Guards to force them loyal.\n\nMind Alteration: Trust\nthe persons trust towards people has been changed to benefit the person\nwho made the alteration, this was seen on one of the person and attempted \nto return it to the original state.\n\nMind Alteration: Hiding\nAllows the target to take on shadodancer-like abilities as well hide from sensing.\n\nMind Alteration: Sensing\nAllows the target to take upon ability to sense others with the power of the All.\n\nPhysical Alterations\nUsually plant-like growths upon the person, the first appearance being painful \nand removal as well. The direct effect was appearance and tended to be very obvious.\n\nPhysical Alteration: Biochemistry\nCreates a desire to eat red meat and numbing the taste of other food.\n\nPhysical Alteration: Advanced Biochemistry\nCreates ability to sustain yourself with iron, water and air alone. Raw flesh of \nsentient beings is the only rich enough source for this. At the same time it allows\nto sustain the level of energy within you and result in Mental Alterations.\n\nPhysical Alteration: Rose Bush Thorns\nPhysical Alteration: Moss beard and Hair\nPhysical Alteration: Growth in Size\nPhysical Alteration: Leaf Skin\nPhysical Alteration: Skin Changes\nPhysical Alteration: Vocal Chords\nPhysical Alteration: Feathers\nPhysical Alteration: Abomination\n\nSensing\nThe more Power the druid had the more able they were to sense others with similar Power reserve, the\ndistance of sensing others depends on the Power Level of the druid. Also this sensing can be through \ntouch being conducted on other person with similar power, being able to contact others mind and look \ninto what alterations there has been made. With high enough power reserve the person can as well \nsense the land itself and the people on it in Ostland.\n\nMelding\nMelding is a process of absorbing Power from others or planting Power in them. A person with higher \npower reserve can absorb the power from others to themselves or plant it to a person with no power \nreserve. However, the water bowl -effect takes place here, if the bowl of water is full already the \nperson absorbing either needs to conduct alteration or other Power consuming activity or remove \nsome of the minds structure to make the bowl bigger and enabling more power within themselves.\n\nThe Creation of the All\nThe persons are as well able to affect the surrounding natural world; at least following has taken place:\nEnsuring bountiful Harvest, Calming the Sea, Ritual of Salvation. A person with high enough Power reserve\ncan as well create waves or calmness and control currents by themselves, these abilities vary depending\nof the caste of the person, naturally the Anchor is most skilled in these. \n\nThe Presence of the All\nIf the vessel of the Power becomes threatened by other beings, harmed or binded by magical means or \nmundane, the Power senses the distress of the vessel and thus will work to defend it, making itself known\nand reaching its power those attacking, trying to influence them if possible and melding power in them.\n\nThe Protection of the All\nThe All as well prevents large amounts of damage against the holder, making the wielder of it highly \nresistant to any kind of damage. Later on the Power starts aiding with healing the body and mind of the\nholder from the damage taken. As well it attempts prevents any divination attempts made against the \nwielder, most likely striking the diviners with its strength.\n\nWild Magic\nBy utilizing the power, it is possible to cast spells as Wild Magic Mage.\n\nStoring the energy of the All\nBy making objects from the bark of the Trees, it is possible to store energy into the objects with \ncombination of water, iron, air and some amount of Power. This Power can be stored in them or absorbed \nfrom them. If the objects are masks and worn they will activate the Power and forcing the wearer lose \nintelligence so that they are more prone to make alteration on themselves by free will.\n\nUntraditional Magic\n\nWild Magic\nIt is assumed that Wild Magic was practiced prior to the arcane casting becoming structured and\nformulated. Once the structured and safer means of casting spells were established the practice of\nutilizing Wild Magic was largely forgotten in the shrouds of time. \n\nWild Mages are a rare school of the arcane casters; they gather their magical forced from the outer planes, in most cases. They\nreject the common notion of various schools of magic, instead insisting it is best to practice the art unfettered by discipline or \nrules. This results in powerful, but unpredictable magic. Many Wild Mages tend to travel to Limbo where the environment is to \ntheir liking, the current of magic unpredictable and where Wild Mages can best utilize their gift. On the Prime, there are locations\nwhere any magic cast inside them work in unpredicted manner, yet their common size tends to be from five feet to larger, \nlargest known Wild Magic area is half a mile in diameter. \n\nThe Wild Mage tend to prefer casting magic in unstructured manner, which results in Wild Magic Surges that either affect the \ncaster, spell, target or surroundings, in unpredicted manner. Possibly healing, damaging or optimizing the spell to harmless \nmagical discolorations of hair, skin or eyes. It is possible that these Wild Mages as well to be stronger than their wizard \ncounterparts temporarily, or find themselves lacking in every casting of the spell. Nonetheless, the Wild Mages are accustomed \nto turn what seems to be a failure to their advantage and when they do get the spell casted successfully, there is a possibility \nthey outmatch any other caster in the region. \n\nWild Magic as well gives powerful abilities to the mage, first of all, able to utilize Wild Magic as mentioned before. But as well to\nutilize the wild magical energies to shield them from harm occasionally, or release a massive outburst of chaotic energy that \nsimply reduce the enemy to ash. \n\nOneiromancy - Dream Magic\nIn the Ancient times, Oneiromancy was classified, much like Blood Magic, to be a 'base' school of magic. One we can refer as \n'Traditional magic' in their own time. Some casters dabbled in this form of magic due to certain very useful spells it contained, \nhowever, the school of magic was shunned by most mages.\n\nOf the few that utilized this school of magic, a gifted individual mage surfaced. The mage who started delving further into the \nsecrets of Oneiromance was able to retain his own awareness during his dreams, a person who is named: 'Lucid Dreamer'. \nThrough furthering his understanding of the school this mage was able to turn Oneiromance into a potent weapon by learning \nto walk in the dreams of others at first. Furthering his studies he was able to force the target into dreaming their greatest \ndesires or their greatest fears, in the end learning to control the body of the dreamer. In the end, he was able to turn a death \nwithin a dream part of the reality.\n\nWithin Oneiromancy, the spells and energies involved can be divided into spellschools as well. They leave a rather prominent\nmark of the school they are part of. In this form of magic, the Weave exists as well, however, the connection to the Weave\nis not similar that it is out of dreams. Potent dream mages can even cease the function of traditional magic within a dream, \nhowever, as each form of magic, this can be resisted as well. By understanding the form of magic heavily relies upon personal\ninfluence, will and control in dreamworld. Through these means the dreamers can influence matter inside their and others dreams,\nhowever, it would be mistake to believe that oneiromancy is simply limited to dreams. It can as well reach beyond dreams and\ninfluence matter within the real world. \n\nKnown users of Oneiromancy: Dream Lich, Lady Darby Mirth, Alanna of Wharftown, Sir Ardelyn\n\nCase: Dream Creation\n\nSchool:\tConjuration, sub-school creation\nLevel: Unknown, ritual.\nComponents: V, S\nDescriptor:\tCreation\nRange: Close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)\nEffect:\tOne or several summoned creature shells\nDuration:\t1 round/level (D)\nSaving Throw:\tNone\nSpell Resistance:\tNo \n\nThis ritual invokes conjuration magical energies by utilizing the sympathetic links the casters have upon the target. By invoking\ntheir memories and feelings. The magical conjuration energies can tap upon a print a creature has left behind on the Weave\nitself. In theory the results can vary, it is possible that this ritual can possibly turn into transportation spell that utilities the\nprint upon the Weave to actually summon the creature before the casters, assuming the creature is alive. If the creature is,\ndead or otherwise bound, what will be fashioned is merely a shell of a humanoid that reflects the memories of the casters \nupon its surface. The memories the caster itself knows. \n\nFeather Magic\nFeather Magic of the Mazticans, not reliant upon the Weave, but semi-localized.\n\nNotable Magical Items Research\n\nAnti-Magic Device\nThe design part is for the proper geometric cutting of a precious gemstone to work in combination with an inverted anti-magic \nfield spell to drain and funnel away magic in an area and amount proportional to the gem volume. Potentially, a one-pound gem\nwould be sufficient to purge an area of few meters, the current operational gem is one hundred pounds. Once activated, the \ngemstone does not get consumed in the progress and the effect is constant. It is uncertain whether a spell targeted at the \nanti-magic gem would take any effect as the volume of the gem is inversely related to the amount of magic siphoned from any \narea in particular. A very large gem has possibility to drain magic in an area of several miles. \n\nThe volume of the gem affects the amount of the basin drawn from quadratically, while the volume drawn is linear. Depending \non how large the 'pool' of magic is, the drain is either noticeable or not. If the drain happens, for examples sake, in a lake, the \ndrain is not notable like it would be in a bath. In theory, the anti-magic gem can be focused to drain magic from smaller area, \nthus rendering the area of, lets say five feet times five feet, of magic, halting any attempts to cast a spell. Yet, would too \npowerful artifacts or spells be targeted to the area, in theory it is possible that the gemstone shatters entirely, being unable to\nhandle such amount of magical energy. \n\nAnti-Magic Device - Crystal Obelisk\n\nBy appearance this device is large crystalline obelisk. The crystal itself is cloudy, however, there are tiny holes across its surface.\nThis device can absorb arcane energy from casted spells and spells being casted in its surroundings. This magical energy can be \nstored and unleashed later on. Once activated, the device can create a thick purple fog around it from it holes. From the same \nholes gray ooze-like substance will begin to pour later on, running on its surface not damaging the device and dripping from the \nbase to whatever lies below. This device can as well change the size of it, it has been seen small enough to be carried in hands \nand large enough to cover a horizon in a pocket dimension. \n\nConjuration Circle of Caras Ravana\nThe runes upon the device are ancient, but recognizable to be aimed for extra planar summoning and binding and magical \nprotections. It is uncertain whether these runes of protection are meant to protect the summoner's from the creature or the \ncreature from the summoner's. Further research upon the device requires skills and understanding in ancient scripts, \nknowledge in conjuration school and possible literature references. \n\nThe Crown of Horns\n\nPortal Wand - Arcanuum\n\nThis wand differentiates from the ones given to general adventuring populace. The head of the wand has a specifically-faceted \ndiamond. It possess a strong aura of conjuration and abjuration. The conjuration aura is tied to the translocation property of \nthe wand. The abjuration is placed to limit the use of wand, the portal wand is devised to work only with humans by race. \nTo further the defensive measures, there is another abjurative aura that prevent all but specific individual from using this wand. \nAn attenuation slot is activated and the portal wand invokes in similar fashion to the general wands once activated. The diamond\nat the end of the wand remains a mystery. The divination and study of the wand have not revealed any explanations to its use \nor if there is any. \n\nTreemason's Cypher\nPreviously known as the Proudbeard Cypher, created by the dwarfen Proudbeard Clan. This device allow the decoding of the\nTreemasons Codex. It as well allows decoding of the Proudbears documentations it was used prior turned into Treemasons\nartifact. This device carries extremely potent defense mechanisms on it and so far means to breach them have not been discovered.\nThe Codex is semi-sentient artifact that has set course it works, it mainly aims to answer the questions of the Anchor. \n\nTreemason's Codex\nA tome holy to the feral druid cult Treemasons. It contains information on the All and history of Ostland. However, only through\ndevice named Treemason's Cypher can this book be decoded. No other mean has been successful in the process of revealing the\nsecrets of it. Only one person is known to have the full information of this tome. \n\nTreemason's Masks\nThese wooden masks can be used to store small amounts of the power of the All. Originally created from the bark of the trees \nin Ostlands, trees that are manifestations of the All. By using a ritual that includes three elements, water, air and iron, the energy\ncan be stored into the masks. Once powered, these masks can awaken their power. By placing on the face of a person, the \npower is activated and the altering of the person can start. These alterations have been set by the creators of the masks and\nonly do what meant to do, to what extent the power stored in them allow. \n\nRitual Scroll: The Binding of the Gods\n\nBinding of the Gods\nItem Type: Scroll\nSchool: Conjuration\nComponents: V, S\nInnate level: None, the spell can not be learned\nTarget: Single powerful outsider, Abberation, Construct or Undead\nRange: medium\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\n\nDescription:\nThis ritual was devised to bind the entity known as \"Living Silver\". In the time it was formulated, the entity itself was not \nnamed. The spell scroll can be used in a ritualistic binding. The name 'Binding of the Gods' has nothing to do with divine \nmagic or actually binding Gods. The spell is arcane and earned this specific name because it allows to bind one creature\nmore powerful than any mortal normally could. However, it is unable to bind Gods or humanoids.\n\nRitual Requisites:\nThe ritual requires seven casters. Only one scroll is necessary though which is read by the lead caster, the other six are \nsupport casters. Together the casters are required to reach certain level of control of the arcane energies, once the point\nis reached the lead caster can activate the spell formula with at the end and if undisturbed, will bind the targeted creature.\nEach participant are required to have certain understanding and control over the magical energies, otherwise they are not\nqualified to access the circle. Each caster within the circle are required to have the same target in plain eyesight. \n\nEffects:\nIf all perquisites are met the target is bound for at least 100 years or possible up to 600 years and turned into solid stone.\nIf the rite has been casted successfully there is no save against it. Immunity to this spell is the only way to negate it.\n\nEntities upon Amia\n\nBlack Dragon Kothar Vutha'garurt\nThe name is associated with tidings of death on the main land, but only in small and secreted villages nearest swamp lands. \nClaims title 'Herald' is self-proclaimed and not even noticeably associated with the name or the ancient wyrm itself. Assaulted a \ngroup of thirty adventurers in Amia Forest, slaughtered almost all of them without taking much harm upon itself. It was not \nable to pierce my defensive warding's or my equipment when I was still a spell blade. Most potent magical effects seemed to \nbring it not much harm, nor the blades of the men. Should be considered a dire threat, it flew after amusing itself to West from \nthe Forest and it's current location is unknown.\n\n\"The Living Silver\"\nThis entitys origins are suspected to be in Dweomerheart. An entity consisting of pure arcane energy with the mentality of a \nchild. All objects or creatures covered by the substance of \"The Living Silver\" absord all but necromancy based spells, necromancy\nbased spells are reflected to the surroundings and cause quite opposite phenomenan than the school aims to. The reflected\nnecromancy spells upon landing to the ground cause life to come forth, such as plants growing from the ground the magic touched.\n\nBefore the entity was bound, its appearance was not as it was seen later on in Amia. It moved freely and it's power has been \nstated to cause life grow in its presence and forming rainbows to the sky. However, due to the child-like mentality the elves of\nCarass Ravana found it being safest to bind this entity. For it's actions unintentionally caused havoc to the settlement. An ritual\nknown as \"The Binding of the Gods\" was deviced and casted, which bound the entity to a prison. By some means later on the \nentity was able to manifest outside of its prison in the form of \"The Living Silver\", a fluid silver metal -like substance that was able\nto roam freely between the regions of the Green Lake and Winya Ravana. In the end, it seems the undoing of this manifestation\nof the entity was undone by subjecting it to anti-magic zone in Cordor Prison, however, the entity was able to resist the anti-magic\nzone briefly, for a while it seemed it would destroy the entire zone before it collapsed. After it, the entity have not been seen again. \n\n\nHerald of Rider from Beyond\n\nAn undead lich, divine based caster, which served the arch-devil Rider from Beyond. Further information is pending. \n\nMoloch\n\nAn arch-devil which was bound by bloodmage Amon underneath Cordor. The archdevil was freed by indefensible act of naivety. \nCurrent location and status of the arch-devil is unknown. It is known to have fought two Solars above Amia Forest with another \narch-devil it had freed. \n\nNeo-Vodak\n\nResponsible for the massacre of Triumvir. A creature that gathered artistic abilities of its victims, targeting mainly bards and \nother performer artists. \n\nOstland Fleshcrafted\n\nThese creatures vary in forms and powers. Some are crafted to strengthen their physical properties to engage front line battles,\nwhile others are crafted to enhance their abilities to call magical abilities or hide similar to shadowdancers abilities. Nonetheless,\neach and all Ostland Fleshcrafted abominations have once been humans or humanoids which through utilizing magic have been in \npainful and dark manner crafted into these horrid creatures they are today. Jarl Roerik Baehri of Ostland is the one developed this\nfleshcrafting practice and uses it to great extents to ensure his position on the Ostland throne. \n\nFinal Words\n\n\"Dear readers, this is just the first volume and much is left unmentioned. The future volumes will \ninclude theories upon other traditional schools of magic, more artifacts and items found and lastly more entities discovered\nupon Amia Island. The work by no means is the final edition as much remains unmentioned due to current events and due to\nsheer amount of work and time is required to have extensive research conducted.\"\n\nI wish success upon your research.\nLady Le'Quella"
