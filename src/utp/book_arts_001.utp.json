      "0": "A small, dark-green book is placed in the library of Cordor. Flicking through the pages briefly, it appears to be a collection of songs. On the front is a small embossed title \"Arade's Songs\", and underneath the title is the author's name written in a smaller print. \"Arade Quin\". A small note on the first page indicates the author's general idea that common adventurer's rarely appreciate music, through a number of swear words and indecipherable rampage of scrawling. The scrawling halts mid-sentence, and the next page and then onwards is dedicated only to written songs. Only the gods know what tunes were stuck in his head at the time to match the lyrics.\n\nPage 1>\n\nI'm here now, in a world that's something new.\nAdventurer's walk around with thousands, that much is true.\nMy own fate is small, my power obselete,\nThe challenges pitted to them will be something I can never meet.\n\nShould I take a leaf out of their books,\nSeek out for gold and glory, falling into the same baited hooks?\n\nAlthough my life is small, and I have nothing to live for,\nThey go out there, seeking endlessly for more and more.\n\nPerhaps I should...\nGo ahead, live life large\nTake the plunge, risk my own life!\nLower my head, ready to charge,\nLive life, on the edge of a knife!\n\nThey seem to be doing it pretty well,\nTaking on evil wrought from hell,\nHow many of them I don't know have fell?\nFor how many has the tone of death...\nRung from the bell?!\n\nAlthough my life is small, and I have nothing to live for,\nThey go out there, seeking endlessly for more and more.\n\nPerhaps I should...\nGo ahead, live life large,\nTake the plunge, risk my own life!\nLower my head, ready to charge,\nLive life, on the edge of a knife!\n\n\nPage 2>\n\nThe Phoenix Prophecy.\n\nIn my final pain I share these words to your hopeful gain.\nWhen hunger walks the streets once more,\nThree Swords shall rise again.\nOne wrought by bitter hate and strife,\nOne wrought by dragon's bane.\nOne wrought by true-light's judging knife,\nThree Swords shall rise again.\nTo turn the tide of darkness,\nTo defend the sick and lame.\nIf you fail we are left hopeless, unless,\nThree Swords shall rise again.\n\n\nPage 3>\n\nThe Dancer.\n\nWhen he walks, in the street,\nThe people all come outside to meet,\nIt always was, the greatest treat,\nTo see the man with the fleetest of feet.\n\nHey, ho, it was a merry old show,\nThe feet did fly and the audience did glow\nThey watched onwards, in astounded glee,\nTo see the sight that they did see.\n\nThen one day, a challenge issued forth,\nFrom a beautiful woman to the north.\nA powerful dance, upon the earth,\nTo see exactly what the man was worth.\n\nHey, ho, it was a merry old show,\nThe feet did fly and the audience did glow,\nThey watched onwards in astounded glee,\nTo see the sight that they did see.\n\nThe man was bested, that was seen,\nHe fell to his knees in front of the land.\nThe womans eyes, they then did gleam,\nShe reached down and then took his hand.\n\nHey, ho, it was a merry old show,\nThe feet did fly and the audience did glow,\nThey watched onwards in astounded glee,\nTo see the sight that they did see.\n\nHey, ho, it was a merry old show,\nThe feet did fly and the audience did glow,\nThey watched onwards in astounded glee,\nTo see the sight that they did see.\n\n\nPage 4>\n\nThe Temple of Love.\n\nThere's a temple in Cordor, on the north side.\nExtravagantly decorated, right in plain sight.\nFilled with extreme beauty deep inside.\nIt's the Temple of Love, come join the ride.\n\nA tribute to goddesses, Sune and Eilistraee,\nShowing true beauty, teaching salvation is the way.\nRevel in the joy of the dance with Lliira.\nThe ideals of Sharindlar will let you go far.\n\nIt's the Temple of Love, the Endless Revel,\nTaking the gifts from above, to a whole new level.\nI never knew that people would live like this.\nLiving their lives in one long endless bliss.\n\nSheela Peryroyl, not the last nor the least,\nEnjoys life in all its forms, from the romance to the feast.\nThere's also the elven goddess, Hanali Celanil,\nThe perfect embodiment that true love has a will.\n\nAll of these deities though can't quite compare,\nTo the High Priestess's deity that keeps alive this affair.\nThe goddess I'm speaking of is known as Sharess\nWho grants extreme pleasure at the slightest caress.\n\nIt's the Temple of Love, the Endless Revel,\nTaking the gifts from above, to a whole new level.\nI never knew that people could live this way,\nTrying a new pleasure every day by day.\n\nEven lust is a fleeting thing,\nGo there to have a massage, it'll last longer.\nThe food there makes you want to sing,\nAn hour in the sauna will make you feel stronger.\n\nEvery day for them is a celebration,\nYet frowned upon with consternation,\nBy those who are modest, timid or shy,\nThey back away and let life pass them by.\n\nIt's the Temple of Love, the Endless Revel,\nTaking the gifts from above, to a whole new level.\nI never knew that people would live like this.\nLiving their lives in one long endless bliss.\n\nIt's the Temple of Love, the Endless Revel,\nTaking the gifts from above, to a whole new level.\nI never knew that people could live this way,\nTrying a new pleasure, every day by day.\n\n\nPage 5>\n\nEyes on the horizon.\n\nI don't know where you were hiding,\nI don't know where you've been.\nI don't know what you will be fighting,\nI don't know what you've seen...\nCan I follow, or am I too weak to be allowed?\n\nYou've set the pace, ran away toward your goal,\nHoping there's treasure, and not some giant hole.\nIt's now a race, others are seeking it too.\nTrying to find the loot that's been eluding you.\nBut that's just not quite what I care about.\n\nBring me along, there's something out there that I want to see.\nTake me along, 'cause there's something else I want to set my eyes on.\nString me along, there's another place that I want to be,\nI'll avoid the fights, 'cause I've set my sights, on the horizon.\n\nI can see the impatience running through your veins,\nWhat challenges are you now thinking of facing?\nYour expenses are making your gold fall into the drains,\nAn idea springs, and you begin once more your dungeon casing.\n\nYou've set the pace, ran away toward your goal,\nHoping there's treasure, not another giant hole.\nIt's again a race, others are seeking it out.\nThe hoard beckons you, yet once more fills you with doubt.\nYou've run away once more, before you could hear me shout...\n\nBring me along, there's something out there that I want to see.\nTake me along, 'cause there's something else I want to set my eyes on.\nString me along, there's another place that I want to be,\nI'll avoid the fights, 'cause I've set my sights, on the horizon.\n\nNow for once, you've decided to hear my words.\nLooking at me, like my desire is so absurd.\nIs there really something wrong, trying to avoid my demise?\nLooking for the real treasure, the scenes that lie before my eyes?\n\nWatching you battle on, your arm held strong.\nYour magical prowess, with unsurpassed finesse.\nWhy don't you trust me, is it something you can not conceive?\nI just want to see the world, how is that hard to believe?\n\nBring me along, there's something out there that I want to see.\nTake me along, 'cause there's something else I want to set my eyes on.\nString me along, there's another place that I want to be,\nI'll avoid the fights, 'cause I've set my sights, on the horizon.\n\nPage 6>\n\nBegin a new life.\n\nI really don't know what to do with my life\nThe panic is setting in, I'm on the edge of that knife\nWhich way do I go, which path should I tread?\nMy unplanned future is filling me with dread.\n\nI took a step and moved a little further on,\nMy life is rolling, starting to build momentum.\nI hope this time, I don't get anything wrong.\nI don't want to end up alone with no one.\n\nThis time I've taken the next step, set myself on a new track.\nThat stranger helped me get a job, figured I'd give it a crack.\nI had nothing to lose, I had nothing to begin with.\nMy previous life may as well have been a myth.\n\nWho really ends up sitting around all day,\nGoing nowhere yet trying to find your way,\nWhen all I really had to do was say,\nI want to begin a new life today.\n\nI started working, I didn't really rush.\nA step at a time, trying to figure my new job out.\nIt was a little much at first, my mind felt like mush,\nOne wrong move would send my senses lost and about.\n\nEventually I started to get the hang of things,\nI finally managed to get myself in a stride,\nWho really knows what the future brings?\nI found a path, so I may as well enjoy the ride.\n\nWho really ends up sitting around all day,\nRelying on others charity to make your pay.\nYour life isn't given to you on a silver tray,\nI want to begin a new life today.\n\nIt still may not be quite what I want out of my life.\nIt's still better than living in eternal strife.\nThe indecision was plaguing me every step by step,\nI found a way to move on, and I'm not out of my depth.\n\nIf this isn't the right path, then I'll have some experience.\nIt's not like finding your own way is an exact science.\nStill, this new thing I'm doing is actually getting me paid,\nWho knows, now that I'm meeting new people I might also get laid.\n\nWho really ends up sitting around all day,\nGoing nowhere yet trying to find your way,\nWhen all I really had to do was say,\nI want to begin a new life today.\n\nWho really ends up sitting around all day,\nRelying on others charity to make your pay.\nYour life isn't given to you on a silver tray,\nI want to begin a new life today.\n\nIt may not be the right choice, but it may not be the only road.\nAll roads reach an intersection eventually,\nPerhaps then I can turn, take a new path once more,\nI'll keep walking on, I'll find the right path for me.\n\nPage 7>\n\nThis is my legacy.\n\nI stopped by in an inn,\nBought a beer on a whim,\nWatched the fly have a swim,\nReached in and flicked it away.\n\nSomeone then noticed my lute,\nHe thought that I was a mute,\nPassed me some of his loot,\nTold me to play another day.\n\nHow about, instead,\nI told you a fairy tale.\nWould you like the story,\nOf barmaidens and fine ale?\nLong nights, sly knaves,\nSecret cults and conclaves?\nI'm a storyteller, you see,\nThis is my legacy.\n\nAfter that word had spread,\nSomething came I had dread,\nWith a hushed word I was lead,\nI was to play for a king.\n\nIt's something a lowly bard should fear,\nIt's tough to impress a lord in his lair,\nHad a brief thought, a risky dare,\nWhen he commanded me to sing.\n\nHow about, instead,\nI told you a fairy tale.\nOf dark times, long rides,\nBlack knights in darker mail?\nDefeated by a prophecy,\nOf dragons and destiny?\nI'm a storyteller, you see,\nThis is my legacy.\n\nOn the way home I was put in danger,\nGot easily rescued by a ranger,\nShe warned me not to be a stranger,\nSo I went along in the direction of her fire.\n\nI then told her my skill, as I followed along,\nStories of power, tales of right and wrong,\nShe asked me to sing, a completely different song,\nBecause rarely could a minstrel earn her ire.\n\nHow about, instead,\nI told you a fairy tale.\nOf a water nymph by the sea,\nRiding an ocean whale?\nA lonely elf, watching on,\nWanting to surf along?\nI'm a storyteller, you see,\nThis is my legacy.\n\nThis completes, this tale,\nCatered to that audience.\nThe tavern drum, the bored king,\nThe ranger with clairvoyance.\nThe moments of light, I had gleamed,\nOf legends that I had dreamed.\nI'm a storyteller, you see,\nThis is my legacy.\n\nWhen I'm gone, will you tell my story?\nOr will I fall victim to history's bane?\nCurse my name, shower me in glory?\nOr be the unwritten words of an empty page?\n\nPage 8>\n\nPlease don't.\n\nI've seen you walking out on the street,\nI've been kind of hoping that we could meet.\nI tried to smile to you as you went past,\nYou smiled back yet continued walking fast.\n\nI saw you later at night, at the local bar,\nYou were watching me, from quite afar.\nYour eyes called to me, innocent and blue,\nI mustered up the courage and talked to you.\n\nWe were laughing a lot, and you looked pretty fine,\nI went for a kiss, I was out of line.\nYou called it a night, perhaps another time.\n\nPlease don't, forget about me,\nJust because, when I close my eyes, \nIt's always, you that I see,\nWatching life, passing us by.\nPlease don't, forget about me,\nCan we meet, just for one more night?\nI know you, prefer to be free,\nStay with me, until the morning light.\n\nThe next day I couldn't help but feel awkward,\nWaking up in the morning, all alone.\nThe girl that I really liked, and I was too forward.\nThat's what I get for leaving my heart prone.\n\nThe street was empty this time, I walked it often enough,\nI walked back to the bar, looking for you,\nI don't really know, perhaps I'm in love,\nOpened the door and met your eyes so blue.\n\nWe were laughing a lot, and you looked pretty fine,\nYou went for a kiss, I thought you might be mine,\nYou called it a night, perhaps another time.\n\nPlease don't, forget about me,\nJust because, when I close my eyes,\nIt's always, you that I see,\nWatching life, passing us by.\nPlease don't, forget about us,\nThe few times, we shared together,\nWhen you look, into the stars,\nJust like them, we can be forever.\n\nI went looking for you, wondering why,\nWhat exactly you really see in me.\nThis time you were talking with another guy,\nMy heart was broken, I was about to leave.\nUntil you saw me and pushed him aside,\nWe shared a kiss, that made me truly believe.\n\nI'm glad you didn't, forget about me,\nJust because, when I close my eyes,\nIt's always, you that I see,\nWatching life, passing us by.\nPlease don't, forget about me,\nCan we meet, just for one more night?\nI know you, prefer to be free,\nStay with me, until the morning light.\n\nPlease don't, forget about me,\nJust because, when I close my eyes, \nIt's always, you that I see,\nWatching life, passing us by.\nPlease don't, forget about us,\nThe few times, we shared together,\nWhen you look, into the stars,\nJust like them, we can be forever.\n\n*some pages near the end of the book seem as if they were torn out in haste upon discovery.*"
