Yes, it's me, but I find it only fair to dedicate such awesome art to me, because I am, after all, the writer. Dedicating this to my mother would be fairly silly wouldn't it? I'm not even sure she wore pants. Not that it's of any importance.\n\n\n\n\nContent\n\n1: Pants.\n2: Pantaloons.\n3: Underpants.\n4: Silly Pants.\n5: Amazing Pants.\n6: Evil Pants.\n\n\n1: Pants\n\nPants are great for legns 'n such, \nwear them and they'll give you much. \n\nWear a pair of Boppiwear, \nyou'll gain power and fancy hair. On your legs. \n\nHair is great and so are women, unless of course they are seamen. \nSeamen arent wearing pants which makes them look silly. Why would they wear pants anyway?\n\nThis poem doesn't make sense, \nbut neither does your face.\n\n\n2: Pantaloons\n\nPantaloons are almost like pants, \nin the sense that you don't wear them on your hands.\n\nPantaloons are fairly nice, \nbut not like pants which I will, during this poem, \ntell you twice. \n\nPantaloons are fairly nice, \nbut not like pants,\nand I have now told you twice. \n\nThis poem actually does make sense, \nbut your face still doesn't. \n\n\n3: Underpants\n\nYou wear underpants under your pants, \nwhich possibly makes your nobby shrink.\n\nIf you discover this, fret not, \ngo to the inn and have a drink.\n\nWhen you come home your lass will laugh at you, \nbut tell the wench loud and clear:\n\nAt least my pants aren't stained with poo. \n\n\n4: Silly Pants\n\nSilly pants are worn by clowns and bards, \nnot to be viewed by the faint of hearts. \n\nThe bards wear them shamefully for all to see,\nas they represent silliness stained with pee. \n\nThe clowns are supposed to be silly, so kudos to those,\na clown without silly pants is like a dog with no nose. \n\nSilly pants will be forbidden by law and burned, \nbeware clowns and bards, the table has turned. \n\n\n5: Amazing Pants\n\nA bird once told me that I was the only to see, \nthat the amazing pants of Amia,\nmust be free. \n\nI raised my sword and fought for justice and light,\njustice for pants and pantaloons alike,\nand light to show off my pants at night. \n\nThus, the battle of the pants was done,\nthe amazing pants were free once more,\nand I was their amazing son.\n\n\n6: Evil Pants\n\nTerry worked at the mill and had a wife to fight,\nhe chopped wood and fed the grinder,\nbut lonely he was at night.\n\nHe wore one set of pants during his life, \nnot once he took them off,\nnot even when he felt the sting of a knife.\n\nThe pants were sent from the abyss to torment and kill,\nthis came as a surprise to Terry from the mill, \nhe was unprepared for the pants' devious hobby,\nas the pants ate his nobby."
