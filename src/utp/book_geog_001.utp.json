Champion of Eilistraee.\n\n\n\nFor months now my heart has been aching with memories of a land so magical, where you can truly achieve nearly anything, maybe even godhood. In that land, the presence of the godly powers is active, more than the most devoted folk at the mainland can imagine.\n\nThis land is called Amia. An island somewhere to the west of Faer√ªn. \n\nWhen I was writing a letter to friends, I said that Amia is among one of the last places on the face of Toril where one who might feel misfitting at the mainland - about everywhere at the mainland - can feel there is a place in the sun or shadows where they can truly be who they are without fear of rejection, persecution, or, even worse, of being the last and only one of your kin.\n\nRacial, political, and religious wars happen at Amia like everywhere else, but everybody has new chances of life there, for death is merciful and, I daresay, has a loose grasp on the land. Kelemvor forgive me for assuming such, if I am wrong. One way or the other, wars are fought, lost, and won, and there is also the occasional foe who rise against the land and will surely cause the whole people to unite - differences aside - and fight against it so they will not lose the only place which accepted them with unjudging eyes, even though once inside the island there is the usual and expected segregation, wariness and tensions between different races.\n\nRare races in all of Toril can be seen at Amia in large, unexpected numerous groups. Or, perhaps, the size of the island gives one the illusion of a size bigger than that you will see around Toril and the cities there, but that here look big because the island is small. If there is a thing I learned about my travels around the mainland in all these years after leaving Amia, is that life is tricky, unpredictable, and surprising. You can find races such as half-ogres among worshipers of Eilistraee, who is usually known by her beauty and love for dance, causing people to misinterpret the faith and frown upon such races when joining the faith. Just like with Eilistraee, here at Amia everyone has a place anywhere. Sometimes you need to fight for acceptance; others, you are accepted without questioning. But that is true everywhere else in this world.\n\nAs long as you share a purpose with other or others, you will never be alone.\n\nIf you are coming to Amia, make sure to have all that in mind, and do not be surprised if you ever see kobolds or even goblinoid races walking amidst the people of the Port City of Cordor."
