      "0": "Book 1: Social Order and Harmony\n\nVerse I: \"I have made every man like his fellow\"\n\nSocial order is important, as is tradition, but within the eye of the God-Kings all men within the realms are equal within the cosmic harmony. No man, property or noble, is above the service he must render unto the Gods, for it is with service that man finds his way into immortality. To maintain the kingdom the summation of all its parts, from the youngest child to the eldest man, from the smallest Oasis to the largest Sepat, must be preserved.\n\nVerse II: \"The highest palm frond owes life to its roots\"\n\nThe Pharoah is served by his subjects for he is the manifestation of the Divine rule of the Gods. The Pharoah therefore must also serve the people for he is answerable to the Gods, for the people, even the lowest property, are also the subjects of the Gods above him.\n\nVerse III: \"I have never seen a man give birth, have you?\"\n\nWomen within the realm are to be granted the same rights to land and the oppurtunity to accumulate wealth and title if they are unmarried or are widowed and the eldest sons are not of age. This is a universal truth for it was Isis and Nepthys who returned Lord Osiris to life.\n\nVerse IV: \"The fairest gems are often found in the plainest earth\"\n\nVenerate intelligence and wit, judge not by birth but by merit. Seek out the able amongst the people, amongst the property, amongst the nobility and amongst the artisan castes. Relate to them the Maat and provide them the means to reach their full potential.\n\nVerse V: \"It is not the victors that write the histories. No, it is the scribes\"\n\nHonor the history of the kingdom of the God-Pharoahs. Offer succour and protection to the literate for the preservation of the Kingdoms history is what allows the truest people of the realms to endure. The lowest scribe is as valuable to the Kingdom as the most literate noble.\n\nVerse VI: \"Better to be property than a pauper\"\n\nAll within the Kingdom serve the God-Pharoahs. If a man, noble or free cannot pay a debt, let him enter the ranks of property gladly. The Knowledge that all men within the Kingdom serve, is the foundation of our glory. \n\nVerse VII: \"The Lion does not maim, nor does he kill without cause\"\n\nAll within the Kingdom serve the God-Pharoahs, and all within the Kingdom are answerable to the Law. Doing injury unto another, without cause or provocation will see the antagonist face justice. Even the lowest of property have a right to wellbeing.\n\nBook 2: The 42 Divine Principles of Ma'at\n\nGuidelines for the weighing of life against the feather of Ma'at. Any breaking of these divine principles requires the devout to seek atonement for the grievance or the heart be heavier or lighter than the feather of Ma'at and the path to the hereafter and eternal peace and contentment within the field of reeds be denied. The 42 principles should be shared amongst all and committed to memory for in the next life one must know all the questions for he shall not be asked them.\n\nI \nI have not committed sin. \n\nII \nI have not committed robbery with violence.\n\nIII \nI have not stolen.\n\nIV \nI have not slain men or women\n\nV \nI have not stolen food.\n\nVI \nI have not swindled offerings.\n\nVII \nI have not stolen from God/Goddess.\n\nVIII \nI have not told lies.\n\nIX \nI have not carried away food.\n\nX \nI have not cursed.\n\nXI \nI have not closed my ears to truth\n\nXII. \nI have not committed adultery.\n\nXIII \nI have not made anyone cry.\n\nXVI \nI have not felt sorrow without reason\n\nXV \nI have not assaulted anyone\n\nXVI \nI am not deceitful.\n\nXVII \nI have not stolen anyone's land\n\nXVIII \nI have not been an eavesdropper\n\nXIX \nI have not falsely accused anyone.\n\nXX \nI have not been angry without reason.\n\nXXI \nI have not seduced anyone's wife. \n\nXXII \nI have not polluted myself.\n\nXXIII \nI have not terrorized anyone.\n\nXXIV \nI have not disobeyed the Law.\n\nXXV \nI have not been exclusively angry.\n\nXXVI \nI have not cursed God/Goddess.\n\nXXVII \nI have not behaved with violence.\n\nXXVIII \nI have not caused disruption of peace.\n\nXXIX \nI have not acted hastily or without thought.\n\nXXX \nI have not overstepped my boundaries of concern.\n\nXXXI \nI have not exaggerated my words when speaking.\n\nXXXII \nI have not worked evil.\n\nXXXIII \nI have not used evil thoughts, words or deeds.\n\nXXXIV \nI have not polluted the water\n\nXXXV \nI have not spoken angrily or arrogantly.\n\nXXXVI \nI have not cursed anyone in thought, word or deeds.\n\nXXXVII \nI have not placed myself on a Pedestal.\n\nXXXVIII \nI have not stolen what belongs to God/Goddess.\n\nXXXIX \nI have not stolen from or disrespected the deceased.\n\nXL \nI have not taken food from a child.\n\nXLI \nI have not acted with insolence.\n\nXLII \nI have not destroyed property belonging to God/Goddess."
